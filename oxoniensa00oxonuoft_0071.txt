CROMWELL. 7³

Skies—that unbound by clasp of mountain ehain,
Slope stately down, and melt into the plain ; ’
Sounds-such as erst the lone wayfaring man

=- δ Caught‚ as he journeyed. from the lips of Pan;

‘Or that mysterious cry, that smote with fear,

Like sounds from other worlds‚ the Spartan’s ear, -

ἐζ While, o’er the dusty plain, the murmurous throng
Of Heaven’s embattled myriads swept along. ”

ἢ Say not such dreams are idle: for the man

Still toils to perfect what the child begam
And thoughts, that. were but outlines, time engraves
’ Deep on his life'; and childhood's baby waves,

Ἰ Made rough with care, become the changeful sea,

Stemm’d by the strength of mauhood fearlessly3

ἢ And fleeting thoughtS‚ that on the lonely wild

Swept o'er the fancy of that heedless child,
Pet-chance had quioken’d with a living truth
The cold dull soil of his unfruitful youth ;
Tin, with his 'daily life, a life, that threw

v Its shadows o’er the future, flower'd and grew,

With common cares unmingling, and apart,
ἶ Haunting the shrouded chambers of his heart3

ζ Tin life, unstirr’d by action, life became

Threaded and lighten’d by a track of flame;
