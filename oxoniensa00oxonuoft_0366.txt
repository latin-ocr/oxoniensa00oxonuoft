the mind cannot rest here ; it is reaching forward to an aby
which it may not now penetrate ; it desires to understand th
future, and what shall be its own part in that future. I

It then turns to a Superior Power, who disposes all events
and therefore can divine them. Nor are there wanting craft

and shews how they have climbed the path to heaven, till by
degrees they become apotheosised.

But how, some one may ask, can man become so degraded
as to worship the inferior animals and the works of his own
hands? The transition from one state of superstion to one

case of Egypt. This people had the knowledge of the true
God in the time of Joseph ; but we find Moses speaking of
the calf, the abomination of the Egyptians, so that in his day
it is plain they had adopted the worship of Apis or the bull.

became serfs, found it an easy task to conceal from them the
truths of religion, and bury them under a mass of fable and
superstition. Nor let any one smile at this, as though it
were impossible ; for no one can tell what may not be brought 2
