10 BATTLE OF THE NILE.

The youthful sailor reads with beaming eye

Thy noble signal—and is bold tu die 1

E'en now, weak emblem of a nation’s love,

Soars thy tall column, Englaud’s thanks to prove3

There thronging crowds shall gaze with hearts of
pride,

Forget their sorrows, fling their cares aside ;

Ages unborn shall read that deathless seroll,

And spurn the ignoble joys of Pleasure’s bowl.

When lawless force and factious stou-ms are rife,

Thy name shall calm the bitterness of strife ς

Then shall thy spirit nobler thoughts inspire,

And Nelson’s memory wake the patriot fire!

And ye, brave sailors! were it mine to raise
A minstrel’s tribute of Maeonian praise3
Had I the art from mortal woof to frame
The deathless texture of immor-tal fame,
What nobler crown were e’er by minstrel wove,
What boon more preeious than your country’s love?
For ye are Albion's chosen, Ocean’s pride,
The cherish’d pledges of his island bride!
There were γε nurtur’d, where her warder rock
Stems the rude wave, and hides the tempest's shock3
Where the hoarse shingle grates beneath the tide,
And screaming storm-birds on the surges ride.
