16 THE CHINAID.

Casama.

How then resist the huge celestia} herde?

Caenus.

E’en thus to sink Keshin and junkery.

CAsnoAn.

For anxious mothers dread indeed to hear ! ! !

Cnost.

To us it seems you'll hear the tale aright,
For by his running, Chinese„ I'll be bound
This man is like to bring intelligence.

Mssssnnossn.

Ο frail pagodas of the Chinese soil!

Alas! Emporium of the best Souchong !

At one fell sweep, the newly-raised Ansam
Hath spoilt our sale, and ta’en the cream off.
But yet I must the thu-illing news unfoltl :
Ah, me ! Chinese, Celestials are done!

Caenus.

Woe worth the day! Woe worth an awful wail !
Come drench your 'kerchieffi at the sad account!
