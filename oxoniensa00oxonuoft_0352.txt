She then collected certain druge, all to concoct a pill. Ι
She mixed and moistened powders dark, and then she went ⁷
to search a
Box she had brought, to find a herb, which she called
“ gutta percha !”
She said she consulted the stars when sick,
And she mixed with her medicine, arsenio ! !
The Count took the pill, and fell back on the pillow,
The Lady Elfaira declared he was ill, oh !
But the Count soon reviving, affirmed he was not ill,
And ordered good Evins, ‘⁴ Go ! fetch me my bottle !’'
The count sipped the flask, shrunk under the blanket; “ He
Then died‚” said the priest‚ “ in the odour of sanctity.'’

Oh ! gentle readers! let me lay before ye
A moral, drawn from this veracious story.
Do not go through woods at night!
Do not with your neighbours fight !
Do not ride a horse that's frisky!
Don't quaff copious draughts of whiskey !
And if anything ail you,
Or if your strength fail you,
And the fever should “ nail” you,
Don’t take those drugs which old women concoct, or
You’ll soon repent it ; but send for the doctor!
And if lte some large pills swallow says,
Look and see that they are ‘⁴ Holloway’s! !’'
This oaution examine, and see what is meant.
Remember 2 dear readers, ne'er say ‘⁶ Eighmagent.”

Tnunommus.
