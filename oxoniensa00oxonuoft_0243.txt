THE CHINAID.

Caenus 01³· Mmmmus.

ΟΡ Chinamen departed to Amoy

¹ The “ Faithful of the Faithful” we are called,
And guardians too of ev'ry snug abode3
For e’en according to oux· portly size
Of corporation‚ mighty Lord Chingyang‚
Keshin-begotten King, appointed us.
But as regards the Royal Host’s return
Of Opium-eaterS, in a screwy style
Our heart doth whirl it round, and sicken us. ⁰
For all the force that China e’er produc’d
Is quickly gone, and moans its novice King.
No breathless rider, dry for drink, arrives
Το tell us Chinamen of those who left
Pekin, or stoutly fenc'd Cantonapa.
On horse, on junk they went, while others tramp’d,
A sorry troop of miserable “ muffs”¹

¹ Muffs] Editors have exerted themselves to find out the applica-
tion of this word. To me it appears that “the softness” of these

articles, so necessary to ladies, is metaphorically applied to the human
skull.
