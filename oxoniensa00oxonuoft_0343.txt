J vourably drawn; that is to say, he brings before us heroes
1¹¹ not possibly more free from evil, but certainly more noble
Ἰ than they are in reality3 and although AEschylus delights in

from all intercourse with his fellow creatures, he acquired
those proud and sels-assuming ideas which degrade his writ-
ings. An amusing instance of his arrogance was displayed
on the representation of one of his plays, when the audience‚
