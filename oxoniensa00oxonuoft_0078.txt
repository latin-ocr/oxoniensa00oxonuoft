14 CROMWELL.

The night of terrors and the day of care,

The years of mil, all, all were written there!

Sad faces watch’d around him, and his breath
Came faint and feeble in the embrace of death.
iThe gathering tem pest, with its voice of sear,

¹ His latest lostiest musio, smote his ear!

¹That day of boundless hope and promise high,
That day that hail'd his triumphs, saw him die!
Then from those §vhitening lips, as death drew near,
'¹‘The imprisoning chains fell off, and all was clear!
Like lowering clouds, that at the close of day,
Bath’d in a blaze of sunset, melt away3

And with its clear calm tones, that dying prayer
Cheer’d all the failing hearts that sorrow’d there !

A Life—whose ways no human thought could scau,—
A life—that was not as the life of man3
A life—that wrote its purpose with a sword,
Moulding itself in action, not in word!

ί clarendon mentions a great sem-m which attendod the death of
Cromwell.

Ι· “He was a great lover of music, and he entertained the most

- skilful in thnt science in his pay and family.”—I'e›sect Politia-ian.

¹ Cromwell died on his fortunate day, the nnniversary of Dunbar
and Worcester‚—September 3rd.

'¹¹ There is a remarkable contram between the perfect clearnesn os
the celebrated prayer Cromwell is recorded to have uttered on his
death bed, and the confusedness of the npeeches which are attributed
to him.
