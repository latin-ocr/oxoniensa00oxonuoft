12 CHARLES THE rwssrrrn.

Yes! one deep quiet—one entire repose

Broods o’er that resting-place of friends and roes,
And the green hillocks, with their gentle swen,
Are all the record that remains to tell,

How Sweden triumphed‚ and how Poland fell.

From Clissau’s field adown the golden west

The sun went hasting to his ocean rest3

But e'er he sank, one glance of glor-y came

To greet the Conqueror on his field of fame.
Strange that no boding, no prophetie sear

F oretold the sunsei of his own career!

Yet why ?—-‘mid fallen potentates he stood
King1y‚ like Calpe, in his solitude,

And earth lay hushed around him: dark and vast
His shadow fell on many a nation cast3

, It swept o’er humbled Denmark‚ eastward far

It flung its terror o'er the haughty Czar3
Behind him Poland low in ruin lay,

Before him Austria crouching in dismay !
And, England‚ e’en thy chief of proudest fame
Paused in the presence of a prouder name ⁹.

And O! if ere there burst o‘er earth and sea
That thfilling sound—a nation's jubileo,

⁹ See the account of Marlborough’s visit to Chai-les 'at Altrnu-
stad, where be received embassies from almost all the Kingn os
Christendom. Voltaire, Trans. p. 98.
