CROMWELL. 9

Au shapes that haunt remembrance3 eost and fair,
Like a green land at suaset, all werethere Ξ

Eyes that he kneW, old faces, unforgot,

Gaz’d sadly down on his unrestful lot,

And Memory's calm clear voice, and mournful eye,
Chill'd every buoyant hope that floated hy3

vLike frozen winds on southern vales that blow

From a sar land—the children of the snow—

O'er flowering plain, and blossom’d meadow fl'ing ⁴
The eold dull shadow of their icy wing.

Then Fancy's roving visione, bold and free,

’ A moment dispossess'd reality.
ἑ- All airy hopes that idle hearts ean frome,

’ Like dreams between two sorrows, went and came:
Fond hem-ts that fain would clothe the unwelcome

truth
¹ Of toilsome manhood in the dreams of youth,

To bend in raptare at some idol throne,

’ Some liseless soulless phantom of their own3
χ Some shadowy vision of a tranquil life,

ζ ijoys unelouded, years unstirr’d by strife3
Of sleep unshadow'd by a dream of woe;
Of many a lawny hill, and streams with silver flow;

s Of giant mountains by the western main,
; The sunless forest, and the sealike plain3

Those linger-ing hopes of cowartl hearts, that still
Would play the traitor to the stedfast will,
