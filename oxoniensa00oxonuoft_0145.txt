Day comes not here,-—or in such spectral guis‘e,
ἡ She seems an outcast from yon happy skies.

In silent awe the Arab steals along,

Nor cheers his camels with their wonted song.
Well may the spirit, left alone to brood

On the dim shapes which haunt that solitude,
O’erflow with joy—that dreary pathway past-
When Petra butsts upon the gaze at last.

O passing beautiful—in this wild spot
TempleS‚ and tombs, and dwellings,—all forgot!
One sea of sunlight far around them spread,
And skies of sapphire mantling overhead.

They seem no work of man’s creative hand,

Where Labour wrought as wayward Fancy plann’d3
But from the rock as if by magle grown,
Eternal-silen t—beautiful—alone !

Not virgin white—like that ord Doric shrine ¹³

where-once Athena held her rite-s divine:

both siden and in some places they overhang the passage, so
as almost to shut out the light of the sky....1ndeed the
whole vast mass of rock seems as if originally rent asunder by
nome great oonvulsion of nature, leaving behind this long,
narrem, winding, magnificent chasm.’' Ibid. p. 516.

k The Parthenon was constructed of the marble from Mount
Peutelicnm,-“ admitting as fine a sursaee, and presenting
aa beautiful a colour, as ivory.” Leake’s Athens, i. p. 334.
