14 THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.

They enme‚——for blessed promise tn prepare

The glorious way to glad fulfilment there.

High are their hopes, as even now they keep

Their midnight wateh upon the star-lit deep,

Still waiting till the Orient shall display

Its glowing presage of that brighter day,

Whose dawning beams on those fair lands shall quell
The powers of darkness and the fiends of Hell.

How blest these hopes,--what ample fruits repaid
Their after toils‚ through Merey’s viewless aid,
Let the wild eehoes of Kairua tell,
Or Kona's eliffs that breast the ocean’s swell,
For they have found a voice responsive there
To Christian aeeents breathing praise and prayer,—
Praise of the one true God, where once there stood
Tane’s altars reeking with the eaptive’s blood,
And prayer in solitudes‚ that heard alone
The vietor’s shout‚—the vietim’s dying groan.
Their Heiau's walls, by native hands laid low,
Their purpose ehang’d, a holier office know,¹⁹
And dark Idolatry no more may claim
Those temples sacred to J ehovah’s name.
