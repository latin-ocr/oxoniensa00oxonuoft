Ῑ hope your head will never ache, before you get that there!” ³

Then up arose Robertus Bright, a right good man was he ς

At the sound of his voice the sprites did rejoiee, and the
woods sang merrily;

And with him rose a Council, with loving hearts and bold ;

They called, and myriad citizens came forth to be enrolled.

It was a noble Council, who toiled with all their might ;

At last they went to Pax-liment, and there rose Robert
Bright ς

Η8 spake and said, “ Your honours? these dues must straight
come down,

For if we bar our Ostium, what hope to save the town 3⁹·

who helped then in their struggle? The true and active
firms ;

And what was then their motto 2† ’twas “ a free port on just
terms.''

And hand in hand they nobly fought, and nobly they have
won ; >

Now, praise arise and reach the skies‚ and travel with the sun!

J oy to the princely bankers! joy to the warehousemen !

J oy to the draper, hosier, tailor ! for Bristol lives again!

There's laughter heard in a printing shrine—good news to
write about :

There are sounds of woe in that of a foe, for there's nought
to fight about.

The parson shall hail the Free Port that filled his church
once bare 3

The little girl in the drawing-roem shall sing the Free Port

air;

· Η8 spake and said, Sir Consul,
This bridge must straight 801118 down ς
For if they take Jamcfflum,
What hope to save the town ἲ Macauzay‘e Horam.
