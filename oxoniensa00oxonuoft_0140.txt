there rocks on rocks-on mountains mountains pil'd—
Have sorm’d a scene so wondrous and so wssd,
T hat gazing there man seems to gaze upon
The rough rude ocean srozen into stone?
F ull well thou know'st! sor sure, when Israel wound
His homeward journey o’er that hallow’d ground,—
Forc‘d in the depths of those wild hills to wait
And kneel, a suppliant‚ at his brother's gale,—
While buruing anthems rose from many a tongue,
Not coldly mute the harp ofJudah hung !
And did not one, in yet remoter time,
Wake there the ‘ birth-notes os the holy chime :W
Doth not to Edom’s rugged land belong
The man os Uz-the Morning-star of song¹’ !

Yea, and to Faney's ear, o'er rock and hill
More solemn harpings there are floating’still.
Hal-ps that long since have been attmx’d above
To hymns of joy, and seraph-lays of love,
In awful strains from many a trembling wire

Have pour’d o’er Edom words os deepest ire!

Ι· Job i. 1„ The date commonly assigned to this Book, the
most ancient in the world, is B.c. 1520.—'1' he land where J ob
dwelt (which seems to have derived its name from Uz, the
grandson of Shem, Gen. x. 23.) is identified with Edom by the
prophet Jeremiah, Lament. iv. 21.
