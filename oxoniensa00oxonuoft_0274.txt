That let the natione batten at their ease—

For he acquired Singsing and all Myhish‚
Without the grumbling of the jealous gods.

The fourth a Tartar, and be sure he prov’d

We caught a Tartar, and in earnest too,

Till brave Foofoo did watoh his hour to sup,
And smote him o'er his “ thimble’' of Souchong.
The sixth was Loo, and seventh Ring·Funk-te-Ki ;
And ‘⁴ last, not least,'’ e’en I obtain'd my lot;
For tho’ I caus‘d the state full many a blow,
Yet ne’er did hit so hard as this Chingyang‚—-
A boy in yearS, and boyish in his plan,

A boy, (alas!) forgetting my behests.

All put together, did not make a mess

So foul, so sad, as this same silly boy.

Outdo the sands, the very earth itself
Does seem allied in favour of their arms.

Cannas

But we'll fit out a proper row ofjunks.
