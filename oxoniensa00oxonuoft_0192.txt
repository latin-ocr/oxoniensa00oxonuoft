1⁴1· 'mm mcxv-MADE BACCALERR.

He sits by 1110 80110010 continually‚
Purdae, the Clerk of the Schools is he,
His office is known to all!

A scholar came, and 110 had his
Testamur in a trice—-

‘⁴ Gaza-00 is passed, I‘m through at last,’'
Quoth he, and shouteth thrice.

We listen’d, and. look’d sideways up !
Fear at my beart, as at a cup,
The life-blood seem'd to sip!
The sun was down, and dim the light, ·.
And Purdue's face by the lamp gleam’d
white, T
From the tiles the rain did drip—
And Pur-due stood at the antu-oo door,
With two testamurs, and no more-—
'Twas a dreary followship.

 

r an· One aster 0110, 111 1110 annu-<30 quad,

Τοο quick for groan or sigh,
Each turn'd his face 'with a ghastly paug,
And curs’d me with his eye.

Twice seven weary living men,
(And 1 heard nor sigh nor groan‚)

That stood 111 the quad by the canu-eo door,
Were plucked one by one.
