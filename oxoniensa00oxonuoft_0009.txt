THE SANDWIGH ISLANDS.

Ἔνθα μακάρων
[Νἱὶσους] ὠκεανίδες

Αδραι repta-vi οοοοοο
Pindar. Olymp. ii. 128.

ΟΝ Albion’s shores, while blending shades of Eve
Their star-spread mantle in the twilight weave,
And whilst in peace it folds earth's wearied breast‚
And pales the amber glories of the West3

What if our thoughts, at that soft tranquil hour
That yields us captive to sweet Fancy’s power,
Transported from the fading scene, should run
The self-same course with the departing sun,
should whisper then, that while he thus restores

· Night's gentle blessings to our heated shores,

To quench his fiery thiu-st he drinks the dew,
Deep in the plantain groves of Oahu.¹

That while our hius a length'ning shadow Βίης,
The wand' ring sea-bird, from his dripping wing,

¹ Oahu and Morokai, two of the largest islands of the Sandwich
group. Oahu is remarkable for its fertility.
