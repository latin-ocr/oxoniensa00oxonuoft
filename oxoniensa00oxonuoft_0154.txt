T hat urge by each endearing claim their prayer 9-
Thy kindred, Edom‚—the redeem’d are there!
Scan well that brow‚—and dost thou mark no line,
No stamp of feature that resembles thine Ρ
Does nought recall an old ancestral tale :—
Two brothers bred in Hebron's happy vde,—
Far Mamre’s oak—where blazed their altar fires ;
And Mamre’s cave—where sleep your common sires P
Or if such ples„ au cruel as thou art!
Can wake no softness in thy rugged heart,
Yet feel sor these—the youthful and the fair,
The weary mother, and her sainting care!
Yea, feel for all—the mighty orphan host,
Which Gon, in love, hath guided to thy coast‘:
Which doth but crave along yon path to roam,
’ And win the haven of its promis’d home :—
And how spake Edom Ρ Threatening words he said

To men whom Edom’s very rocks had fed:

¹ lt can scarcely be necessary to suggest in illustration of
the preceding verses the history of Isaac’s two sons :—Mamre,
(or Hebron) the residence of Abraham and Isaac, and the
scene of Gon's visit to the former patriarch ;—the cave of
Machpelah, where Abraham and Sarah were buried, and
where Esau and Jacob buried their father Isaac z—and the
circumstance that all but two of those who entered the hand

os Promise had lost their parents in the wilderness.
