16 THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.

But twilight scenos like these recall once more
Their parent musings on our island shore3
Albion! to thee once more our thoughts incline,
From lands of which Diseovery's meod was thine,
In that proud day that bade a nation leap,

As 'twere a new creation, from the deep,—

And worlds to' last when these have pass’d away;
No earthly flame that warms th' insensate clod,-
But fite from altars of the living God.
