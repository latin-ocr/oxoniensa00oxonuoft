Lost in wonder at this strange scene, it was some time
before Ι perceivcd my future preceptor standing at my side.
I involuntarily shrunk from him; but, with an encouraging
look, he took me by the hand, and seeing my amazement at
the edifice before mc, pointed to the pediment of the portico,
on which was sculptured a miniature of the same temple.
On the summit was seen one adding another stone to the
