following accounts Ι give without comment, not to say t
there are hundreds of similar tales that appear to be well ¹
tested3 but these fell within my personal acquaintance, a
I know the parties concerned to be highly incredulous
such things. In the first, a gentleman having a relati
lying ill, was aroused one night by a knocking which seem
to be made near the looking-glass‚ and which was thri
repeated3 after which a voice said, M is dead. But wh
renders it so singular is, that his wife, who for some reaso
was sleeping in an adjoining room, heard all that passed
distinctly as her husband ; which was disclosed when on th
mori-ow a letter came with tidings of the death of the indi
vidual in question. The second account is of a military mans}

 

who, one day standing near his wife, saw the figure of a man]
leaning over her shoulder‚ and said “ that man will be your
future husband.”' No such a person was then among their
acquaintance ; but it remains to be mentioned, that a fac-
aeimile of the previous apparition was afterwards introduced
to them, and in process of time married the lady. Such
fancies as these, as well as the belief in luck so prevalent in
Wales‚ Cornwall, and Ireland in our days, were no less re·
garded by the ancients; scarcely an emperor died but his
statue was struck by lightning, and a raven croaked over him,
or some similar prodigy is recorded3 and trivial as these
fancies may appear, they nevertheless have a considerable
share in the formation of Mythology. Those who have read
Borrow's “ Bible in Spain‚’' will have no difficulty in con-
ceiving that it would hardly require the mind of Goethe to
transform some of his gipsy adventures into a romantio ballad
or even a super-natural story. Indeed, so consistent are
poetic figures with the superstitions of mankind, so easily do
the one drop into the other, that we may safely look for the
groundwork of superstition among the traditionary verses of
the early bard, and style the poet, if not the “auctor‚” at
least the “ pater patratus ’¹ of Mythology.
