THE CHINAID. 21

Were numbered all, and ten of them were piek’d,
Chingyang (Ι know Ἰ) a thousand vessels led,
Two hundred “ crank,'’ for thus the story runs,
E'en seem we now deficient in the fight?

But, sure, some deity destroy’d the host,

In envy kick’d the equal·poising beam,

Tho' gods preserve the shrine of Laokung.⁶

Casama.

But what! Is Britain’s isle not desolate?

Messanam.

While men are in her, sure is her defence.

CAsnGAn.

Explain the prompt beginners of the fray,
Whether the Britons or my noble boy
First mingl’d fight, e'en vaunting multitude?

Mssssnnomz.

Some Fury, mistress, or an evil god,

E'en ev’ry evil of the host began.

For there did come a villanous Sepoy

From Britain's force, who thus address'd thy son:

‘⁴ That on a night both drear and dark” with clouds,

ὅ Laokung] He was supposed to be the inventor of religion for the
Immortals.
