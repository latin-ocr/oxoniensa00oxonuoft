10 THE CHINAID.

And draws a mortal to its fatal toils—

That “ bourne from whence no traveller returns.''
Such Fate of old from out its seven realms⁴

Hath urged all China to the wara that j0y

In fell grenades, and noisy cannonry:

From Pate it learnt to view the briny waste

Of sacred Hoaug, and to trust in oars

All “ sprung‚” and in such host-conveying schemen.
On this account, our heart doth wear a suit

Of “ seedy'' blank, most fearfully despoil’d.

Ab, me! for lest the rabble rout should leave
The mighty city of Pekin, alas!

The Cochin fortress, empty of its men!

(Ah, me Ξ and sure enough, do what we will,
Those women's tongues will mag incessantly !)
And, truth, upon our silken “ togs”⁵ there’s come
A great considerable damage.

On horse, on foot they went, like swarnning bees,
And must e'er long have finish’d to their beart
The strong-cemented work of masonry.

Our Chinese dames with tears bedew their couch,
And wives do mourn their absent lords’ return3
For each hath sent her pax-amour in arms,

⁴ Seven reahns] Ringtum wan promoted from the sixth to the
second heaven, for asserting that βαρβαροι had ceased firing.

⁵ Toga] Boz, in his “Wcllerisms,'’ bath dilaoed largely on this
subject: he applieth the term more particularly to obese stage-
coachmen.
