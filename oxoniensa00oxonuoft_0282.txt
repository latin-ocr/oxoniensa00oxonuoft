46 THE CHINAID.

Cnumnuo.

We're struck, alas! by fortune’s jealous dart.

Cnonus.

We're struck, ’tis plain, but sorrow waits us now,
Altho’ the Britishers so hammer'd us!
Unhappy lot! Thou tace of Chinamen !

Cumanae.

”ris strange that Ι, most wretched hasty boy,
Should be so smitten with Celestial men!

Caunus.

Why strange? Is China not abased, my lord‘?

Cmumuuo.

See’st thou this remnant of my sorry rag's‘?

Caunus.
We see, we see!
Cnmouxm.
This quiver, too?
Cuonus.
What say'st?
meonuo.

This small receptacle sor deadly shasts?
