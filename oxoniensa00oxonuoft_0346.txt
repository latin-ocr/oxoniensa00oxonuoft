should surpass all those who had gone before him, for having¹

Dr. Major has compared the three tragedians to cele-
brated painters. AEschylus‚ from his boldness and sublimity, 3
his wild but fantastic images, he styles the ω· Βοωαῃῧῖ
of ancient tragedy. Sophocles, by the justness of his or- ⁴
dinances, the exquisite grouping of his figures, and the bril· ⁴
liancy of his colom-s, is pointed out as a Meum and Eu· A
ripides, from the softness of his pencil‚ may not unjustly be
hailed as the Correggio of the ancient drama. To follow out
this plan in latter day poets, we should couple together the
names of AEschylus and Shakspeare, Sophocles and Milton,
Euripides and Byron. There is a passage regarding Ezekiel
so exactly corresponding to our notions of AEschylus‚ that we
are tempted to transcribe it.

“ The style of this prophet may be characterized as bold,
vehement, and tragical3 as often worked up to a kind of
tremendous dignity. '⁵ * ἱ· * He is employed rather
in exciting our terror, than in moving our pity ; and describes
the manners of his countrymen under the strongest and most
exaggerated representations the license of the Eastern style
would admit.”*

With this quotation we must close our paper. Much
more might have been said; however, doubtless‚ you agree
with us that quite enough has been said, and so we bid you
heartily farewell‚ hoping that this brief sketch will lead you
thoroughly to investigate for yourselves their noble efforts of
genius ; the only way, be assured‚ of coming to a right con-
clusion on their respective merits. Ω.
