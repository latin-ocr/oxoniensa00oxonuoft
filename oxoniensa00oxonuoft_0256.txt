20 THE CHINAID.

Thriee-my'riad leader of a swarthy crew,
Quite chang'd their colout· to a purple tinge,
And dy’d his bushy looks of oarroty,—-
Kayuk the Tartar, and the Burmese Kin,
The wretched tenants of unfriendly soil,—
Tongting, and Choo, and mighty Futtibosh
Affording trouble with his arrow-heade,-—
And Kiangu, no coward he, I trow,
Lyrnean chief, and comely in his form,

Of fifty times five hundred junks the lord,——
All these lie dead in death ; while first Chelang
Mantchoosan Sheik, in hardihood of soul

Oppos‘d his portly person to the toii
Os thiekest foemen, and in glory fell.

Of these our captains Ι remember now,
Though few, ye stare! of many woes Ι tell.

CAsnoAn.

Ah! woe is me! supreme of ill I hear
Disgrace to Chium, and a dismal howl.
But now relate, returning to the theme,
How great the number of Britannia ships
That dared to battle with the Chinese host,
And mingle conflict with Immortal junks!

Mussnnomz.

O rest assur’d, we Chinamen had most,
For ten times thirty squadrons of Chinese
