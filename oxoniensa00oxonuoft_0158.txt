She keeps no feature of her ancient sace:

There breathes not one of Esau's royal race‘:

And while yon stars in tunesul circles roll,—

While Summer cheers, and Winter ehills the pole,—
While Night and Day in soft succession shine‚——

So long shall Edom o'wn her doom divine:

v. 1-16, and v. 17—2 Ι .) The writerjudged he could not more
fitly conclude his verses than by exhibiting this contrast, in
terme borrowed from propheey.
