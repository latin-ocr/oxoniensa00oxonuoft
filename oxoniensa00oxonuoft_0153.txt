Then F aith⁶ with thee her sacred mansion-mad&
And holy lips, within thy summer shade, Δ
Os bright Arcturus and Orion told 3—
And the sweet sway the wand’ring Pleiads hold03—
And os the matin hymn which burst sublime
From all Creation at the birth of Time 3
When ‘ Earth sels-balanc’d on its centte hung,'
And ⁴ all the morning Stars’ like seraphs sung.—-
Such were the themes thy children* lov’d to hear
When first they dwelt along the vales os Seir.
While youths and maids from each. romantic town
Went forth in dances when the sun went down3
And antique tale, and legendary song,
And harp and timbrele made the night less long.
But who are these‘ that kneel in lowly state,
And plead sor love at Petra’e haughty gate ;
⁰ Job xix. 25—27.

d “ Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiade-S, or
loose the hands of Orion.....Or canst thou guide Arcturus
with his sons ΞΝ Job xxxviii. 31, 32. See also ix. 9.

e “ They send forth their little ones like a flock‚ and their
children dance. They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice
at the sound ot· the organ.’' Job xxi. 11, 12.
