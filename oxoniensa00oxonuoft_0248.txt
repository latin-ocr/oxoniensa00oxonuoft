12 THE CHINAID.

Since things are thus, with kindly good advice
Assist, ye tried Estates of Crockery,
For all my mensures do repose in you !

Cnonus.

Be well assur’d, Ο Queen, not twice to speak,
“ No sooner said than done” ’s our motto.

Casuum.

I’m rack'd by nightly dmams, and get no sleep,
E'er since that Chingyang fortified Amoy.

Last night I saw most clearly, in a sort

I never saw before. I’ll tell it thee :—

Two comely men, in decent vest array’d,

I seem’d to see: the one of them did wear

‘⁶ Nankeen continuations,'’⁶ while the other

Those “ inexpressibles’' of divers shade3

Both firmly limb’d, and both in colom· white.

They dwelt-the one, 'neath Albion’s chalky cliffs,
While ’tother “ guess’d'' he liv’d with “ Uncle Sam.”
These two did seem to bicker3 when my son

E’en chas'd them both, and fum’d, and look’d as tho’
He’d ride them both as ‘⁴ hobby,'’ and alone

Would hook them to his car, and gall their necks.

⁶ Continuations] Fergusonius facetiously observeth, ‘⁴ No end of a
pair o' breeks.’' But I have remarked‚ in my ‘'E-›recurrepow-ra, that
“ long-shorts” are equivalent to ‘¹ lengthy productions.”
