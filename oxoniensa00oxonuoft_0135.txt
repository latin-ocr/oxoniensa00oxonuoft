 

PETRA,

THE capital of that portion of Arabia which is thence

called Petraea, occupies a mountain-hollow in the rocky

region known as the Land of Scir: extending from the

north-eastern extremity of the Arabian gulph to the

south of the Dead Sea 3-—a territory which the Almighty

assigned to the Edomites, or descendants of Esau.

It is twice mentioned in Scripture by the equivalent

Hebrew name SELAH‚ or the Roclc: and thenceforward‚

(namely‚ from the seventh or eighth century before our

aera‚) it obtains no further notice for four hundred years.

During this interval the Nabathaeans, or descendants of
Nebaioth, the eldest son of Islunael, had expelled the-
Edomites from their ancient stronghold, and driven them

northward, where their territory was recognised for a few

centur-ies under the Hellenized name of Idumaea. Then

it was that one portion of the prophecy concerning the

descendants of Esau obtained its fulfilment: they faded

from the world's eye, and ceased to be a nation.

Petraea, henceforth part of the Nabathaean territory,
became a Roman province; and ΡΕΤΒΔ, as some ancient
historians relate, and as its astonishing ruins abundantly
tmtify, continued to be its wealthy and flourishing capital.
