CROMWELL. 15

Rent with tumultuous thoughts, who e conflict rung
Deep thro' his soul, and chok' d his saltet-ing tongue3
ξ Α heart that reck’ d not of the countless dead,
g That strew ’d the blood· stain ’(1 path wheie Empire led;
{A daring hand, that shrunk not to fulfil
The thought that spurr ’d it; and a dauntless will,
Ἀ Bold action' s parent3 and a piei-cing ken
Ξ· Τ111·ο’ the dark chambers of the hearts of men3
ξ To read each thought, and teach that master mind

ξ’ The feam and hopes and passions of mankind3
All these were thina—Oh thought of seart-and thou

Stretch’d on that bed of death, art nothing now.

  
     
  

 

J Then all his vision faded, and his soul

Sprang from its sleep! and lo, the waters roll

³ Once more beneath him; and the fluttering sail,

· Where the dark ships rode proudly, woo’d the gale 3
>And the wind murmur'd round him, and he stood

-Ὶ Onoe more alone beside the gleaming flood.
