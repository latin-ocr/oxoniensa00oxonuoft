BATTLE OF THE NILE. 9

The giant Pyramids—Eld’s mystic pile—-

The desert's trackless graves—the life-streame of the
Nile ἱ

But where the victora 'I--where the exulting cry,

The thrilling shout of conscious victory?

Why are they silent? Nay, be silent thou Ξ

Hush’d be each whisper--hear the neaman’s vow Σ

“ Kneel, comradeS‚ kneel! let faithless Gallia mourn 3

“ Learn that God's scorners are themselves a scorn.

“ Be Albion's sons with holier thoughts imbued‚

“ Their first glad breath be spent in gratitude 2 e

“ Not unto ns be praise or glory given——

“ Not unto us--but to the Lord of Heaven!

“ But that His aid was ours, we now may say,

“ But that His arm upheld us in the fray3

“ We had not stemm’d them in their surging pride,

“ Our souls had perish'd ’neath the whelming tide.

‘⁴ No arm of man, no mortal's boastful swerd,

‘⁴ Wrought this deliverance —-’twas Himselss the
Lord !'’

Nelson! thou richest gem from glory's mine l
A priceless meed-a nation’s thanks are thine;
For thee the grateful chaplet Albion wreath'd,
Thy bright example to her so‘ns bequeath'd:

And still, midst waning years, the hallow'd flame
Of patriot ardour kindles at thy name3
