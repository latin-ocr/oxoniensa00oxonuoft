BATTLE OF THE NILE. 7

The startled Arab heard the distant sound,
And deem’d dread Azrael shook the quaking ground3

Far reach’d the fragments of that deadly shower,

From lone El Rashid⁵ to Aboukir's tower 3
Whilst the scar’d echoes on far canaan‘s shore

In fainter eadenoe murmur’d back the roar—
Wide as the view from Pompey’s column'd pile,6
The towery guardian of the wealthy Nile3

Bright as the flame that erst in prouder days
Stream’d from old Pharos' roek--a warder blaze !

By Mizraim's storied shores the ling'ring sun
Gleams 0’er ⁴the fight, and hails the avenging gun.
God of the East! he marks her threat’ned woes,
And glares red anger on her dal-ing foes:

Nor hid, pale crescent, be thine amber light;
Thine are the wrongs, and for thy weal the fight.

. ln motley groups around Canopus' bay

Thy swarthy votaries wateh th’ unwonted fray; ι
And, half in wonder, half in terror, prees

To curse the invader, and his foes to bless.

There the fierce Mamluke stays his fiery steed,
Whose God is war, and victory his creed;

nalsance aux vaisseaux, et guide les Arabes dans les plain nnnnn

moins vastes, et nues du desert.”-Histoire d'Eyypte. Antt'q. Decor.
