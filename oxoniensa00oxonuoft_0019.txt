THE SANDWICH ISLANDS. 15

Religion's soothing voice at length imparts

Her sost'ning lessons to their savage hearts;

Ost, as the spirit of a breathless calm ⁹⁰

Sleeps in the unsway’d shadows of the palm,
Beneath the grateful shade they sit‚—-and tell

How Rono 2¹ thither came‚-——how Rono fell 3—

And gentler promptings teach their lips, though late,

ἱ To bless his coming,—and bewail his fate.

Α What if no cenotaph enshrines his bones,

7 A nation’s gratitude their crime atones;

ι, Though with his laurels twine no poet’s bayS,

A nobler anthem may proelaim his praise3

For oft the mariner, at close of day,

While 'mid those Isles he tracks his dark'ning way,
Hem-s, sostly stealing through the twilight (lim,

Wafting a happy presage to his ear,

That genial hearts and helping hands are near,—
That there a friendly welcome would be found,
Where Christian saith, and Christian laws have bound
In one wide brotherhood,—one vast embrace,—-

The swarthy savage and his paler race,

, ——Links of that heavenly chain that Mercy wove,

Το compass peace and harmony and love.
