but, as the sole produce'of the morning's occupation, it was
consigned to the fair hands of his daughter, who immediately
proceeded to prepare it in the usual manner for the noon-tide

something glitter ! Reader, picture to thyself‚ if thou canst,
the emotions which heaved her breast and flushed in her
cheek on perceiving that the glittering object was—the point
of the knife which had broken against the back-bone3 all
else was the entrails of the fish, which no doubt proved very

nice for dinner.

Swollen with torrents it rushes along,

Pindar thus sings with his vast tide of song-
Mighty commotion.
