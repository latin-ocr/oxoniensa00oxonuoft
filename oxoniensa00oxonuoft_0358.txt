Nature in her grandeur and in her simplicity‚ he seemed to
tear aside the manacles that imprisoned his benighted vision, f
and to behold everything with unbeclouded eye. As he de-

up his last accents, continued the strain3 and, though with a
polish and a sweetness peculiarly his own, repeated or imi-

The next compartment was sacred to the lyre, and first a

bright that I thought the light of Christian revelation was
about to burst around him.

Hastening to the fane of Eloquence‚ Ι found it already
crowded by an Athenian audience, who were spell-bound by
