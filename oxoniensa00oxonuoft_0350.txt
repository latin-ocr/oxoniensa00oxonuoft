And if 1 win the baron's gold—ah! do not shed that tear,

Nor think that Ι shall catch a cold, whilst you’re at home,
my dear; ¹

There's not a baron in the land, nor if he were a lord,

Should win my lands, while I could wield my strong and
trusty sword :

They must fight, if they act as thieves, as he has done to me ;

Remember me, Elfalra, love ; and now farewell to thee !

The count looks up, and shouts aloud
His orders to the gallant crowd ;
‘⁶ Mount ! mount ! my brave, my merry men,
“ To horse! to horse! and through the glen
“ Straight to the baron’s castle g03
“ Hark! hark! away, yoicks! tally-ho !
“ And if you know—forward halloo !—
“ His men come in your ‘⁶ potestatem‚”
“ Give quarter? none3 but spiflicate 'em.
“ And he that brings to me the head
‘⁴ Of Baton Eighmagent‚ when dead,
‘⁴ Void of hrains and full of lead,
“ Shall henceforth eat from off my table,
“ Have the best horse in my stable‚
“ Hunt or fish, as he is able,
‘⁶ In the lands of Glyglumgleagh, he and all his family.’'
Thus spoke the Count, in merry mood,
“ Hark to me, my archers good,
“ Hide ye in yon tangled wood ς
“ When ye hear my shrill horn blow‚
‘⁶ Swiftly to yon castle go,
‘⁴ Range yourselves in order, and '’—
Here the leader of that band,
Stepping forward, bow in hand,
said, ‘⁴ stay, Sir Count, that's quite enough,
All right, old eove ! I'm up to snuff !'’
