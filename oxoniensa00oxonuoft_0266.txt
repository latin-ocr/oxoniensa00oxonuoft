30 THE CHINAID.

Hooroosh ! Hooroosh !

No more will nations own the Chinese sway,
Or pay such tribute to imperious pow'r,

Or meek salmam, and bow them in the dust,
For all the might of royalty is gone.

No more will mor-tals bind the prating tangue,
For· all are free to sputter as they choose i
That bleeeding soil of sea-girt islet, Hong,
Now holds the fortunes of the brave Chinese.

CAsHGAR.

To me, ye loves, now all is full of sear,

And gods do seem most adverse in my eyes,
With shouts unpleasant dinning in my ears—-
A second time I therefore left my home,
Depriv’d of palanquin, or shutter'd van,⁴
And bear paternal off 'rings osa son,

The sweetest soothings to unhappy dead!

The best white milk, tho’ skimm’d, of brindled eow,
New “ virgin honey'' of the toiling bee,
Some wat'ry droppings of pellucid spring,
Unmingl'd, “ neat,’' of mother wild and free,
The strongest extract of a sturdy vine ;

⁴ Shutter'd van] Commentators have much exerted themselves ou
thia point, nome likening the vehiele hero mentioned to a svo-mm and
others to the conveyance of wathes-women ς but surely it must signif,
an “universal particular,” or “ private omnibun.”
