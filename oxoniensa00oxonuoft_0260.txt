24 THE CHINAID.

At first the stream of our celestial host

Withstood the fight3 but when the crowded ships
In narrow room were thrust, and none could give
Assistanee to his fellow, they themselves

Did “ foul themselves‚” and break their oamge.
Britannia ships, and with design, I now,

VVere pouring grape·shot round, and ‘⁴ riddling” all
The hulls of vessels, as no sea is seen,

So teem'd its bosom with the wrecks and gore,

So groaned the shores with corses of the dead.

In flight disorderly each ship was pull’d,

At least as many of our fleet as could,

While they as thunnies, or a cast of fish,

Did cleave and strike us, 'midst the wreck ofjunks,
A lordly bellowing possess’d the brine,

Until the eye of murky night restrain’d.

Nor if ten days my abacus I told,

Could Ι fill up the multitude of ills;

For‘I would stake, that in no single day

So many mortals met a sorry death.

Cisnmn.

Ales! a mighty ocean of our ill
Hath burst on China, and immortal racel
