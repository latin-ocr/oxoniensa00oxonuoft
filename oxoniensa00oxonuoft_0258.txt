22 THE CHINAID.

The Britishers would quit, and loudly pipe

“ All hands on deek,'’ and by a stealthy course
Preserve their lives, and indireetly ‘⁴ mizzle.''
But he, on hearing, knew not of the “ dodge”
Of wily Sepoy, nor of stari-y ire,

And thus he issued to his naval chiefs ε

“ That when the sun should quit the glowing earth,
And darkness cover the domain of air,

To range their junks in triple row and file,
And watch the flowing of the briny floods,
While others circle round the isle of Fo!

So that if Briton 'scape his evil lot

By neatly ‘ skulking' from the vessel's port,
That all should pay the forfeit—minus, head.”
Thus much he spoke, the guerdon of his mind,
Nor knew the future from his twinkling gods·
But they in order, and obedient zest‚ ⁵
Despatch’d their dinner, and sea-going man
Each plied his oar in easy-rowing thong3

And when the glorious light of day had wan’d,
And night advanc’d, each man the lord of oar,
E'en trode the plank with overseer? of arms.
The rank cheer'd rank of each Immortal junk,
And “ pull’d‚'’ as thus it was appointed them,
While all night long the captains of the ships

poor.”
