40 THE CHINAID.

Nor let Chinese, o’ergorg’d with stomach full,
Desire that opium to allay his maw,

And reeling quit prosperity and life.

For gods detest a palate over nice,

So plain is their supreme Imperial fare.

O therefore teach my ‘⁴ son, my own brave boy‚’'
To rule his appetite, and draw it mild.

And thou, belov'd‚ old mother of Chingyang,
Go home again, and hither bring a vest,

Of ‘⁴ newest cut,'’ the ‘⁶ fastest’'8 that you ean;
For I'll be bound his jacket's all in holes,
“Continuations” seedy, too, I trow.

O sooth him kindly with mellifluous words,
For thee alone, I'm certain, he wil! hear.

But I'll away, to seek my den below.

Do ye rejoice, Ο Mandarins, I say,

Tho' sorrow press, throughout the livelong day,
As wealth to “ bodies'' does not, cannot pay.

(Shade qs Keslcz'n descends.)

Cnontxs.

O what a pain did twinge our blushing nose,
At hearing ills both present and to come!

CAsqun.

O gods, what woes discharge their fury now!

⁸ Fastest] Lucus a non lucend0; inasmuch as fast-cut clothes,
srnm their accurate fit, impedo tho motion.
