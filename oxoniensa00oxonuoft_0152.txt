Swift—-sweeping—sudden—whensoe'er it c'mne;
Blighting aud b1asting‚—like the breath of statne.
One piercin'g cry—one agonizing wail—

One voice srom Edom's cities told the mle:

One cry os bilte1·ness——-and all was o'er;

But the far echo smote the Red-Sea'shore·;
And peal'd along its walens—till the waves

Made hollow answ'er from their cdral caves '’ !

How chang'd,‘O Edom, since (hat honr, the scene
From what the morning of thy days had been!
When many a valley rich with corn and wine,
VVhenstreams of earth, and'dews of Heav'n were thiue3
And floeks and hemis—a patriarch’s ample store—

Tin all thy cup with plenteousness ran o'er0.

⁸ ‘⁴ Hear the counsel of the Lonn that He bath taken against
Edem. . . .The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the
cry, tlte ποίεε tlzereqf was heard in the Red Sea.” Jerem.
xlix. 20, 21.
¹³ An Italian traveller relates of his voyage on the Red Sea,
“ that the weather was so culm, aud the water so transparent,
that he amused himself by obeerving the peculiarity os the
depths beneath him, where weeds and corals grew to such a
size, and εο disposed, as almost to have the appearance of
groves and gardens.”
‘- The terme of Esau's blessing (Gen. xxvii. 39.) well agree
-with what we read of the pastoral wealth of Job. (Job i. 3.)
See also the evidence of a similar kind afforded by Numb. xx.

17: but ‘ He turneth rivers into a. wildemess, and the .

watersprings into dry ground3 a fruitsul land into barrenness,
sor the wickedness of them that dwell therein.¹'
