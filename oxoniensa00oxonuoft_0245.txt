THE CHINAID.

With Kian bowmen3 and the tinsell’d Heng
Sends forth a gilded rabble crowd, array'd
In guise of J unkites‚ warriors of the bow,

While wives and parents day by day recount,
And counting shudder at the length’ning term3
For now the tea-producing host has gone

To forge a lime-bound handicraft, and rear
A stony eauseway‚ much cemented o'er
With Claridge’s asphalte, or bitumen,

To check the sons of Albion and St. George.
’Gainst all the world, by land and sea afike,
In full relianee on his ‘⁶ awkward squad‚’'
Our chief does urge his troops celestial‚

A fiery man, and sprung from glitt’ring race,
That sported ne'er but “ paste and real Mosaic.'’³
A toady glare he looks from out his eyes,
And drives a Calmuck pair of Tartar hacks,
And goads Toxopholite on musketry.

Nor is there found a man of soul to stand
This mighty flood, tornado of a host

In swelling stream that roars invincible!

For who avoids the envious eye of gods,

01· bounds so lightly with his agile feet?

For Fate at first so fondly lures us on,

³ Paete and Mosaic] Vide Snobbiculos ad infinitum.
