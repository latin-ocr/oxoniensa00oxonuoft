ARGUMENT.

SACRED associations allow us to regard the land of Edom
almost as the birth-place of song.—ln the desolation with
which it has been visited, Petra has shared largely.—Enviable
feelings of the Traveller who discovered its forgotten site.—The
magnificent scenery around Petra‚-recalling the miracle of
the Exode.—W0nderfu1 approach to the city.—Meditation on
its beautiful ruins.— The grandeur-gaiety (suggested by the
remains of a theatre)—and flourishing condition of Petra in
the time of the Romans‚—fr0m which, in common with the
rest of the cities of Edom, it fell by some awful but unrecorded
visitation.—The early and later state of the surrounding country
contrasted.—Its present barrenness exhibite the fulfilment of
the prophecies concerningi13 denounced chiefly in consequence
of the hostility of the Edomites against the children of Israel.

The Poem concludes by contrasting the hopeless desolation
of Edom and the extinction of Esau’s descendants, with the
prospecte of the Holy Land and the glorious promises in store

for the posterity of Jacob.
