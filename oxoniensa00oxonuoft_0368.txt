valley of the Nile3 now lulled by the soft tones of unsee
musicians, while beatific visions of damsels in glory flitt
before the gaze of the beholder, fascinated and bewildered by
every unearthly accompaniment. The same has been the>
case in other countries. The Chinese priests use the as-
sistance of jugglery ; the Hindoo fakir suffers himself to be
wrought upon by the juices of opium; the Persian magi
pretend to draw down fire from heaven; the rainmaker of Ι
of Africa employs the arts of divination; and the druidical
remains, all over the world, bear the marks of magic rites.

So much for the manner in which the rise of Mythology
may be accounted for philosophically. Next for its actual
origin and progress. The first thing we notice in almost
every system of Mythology, is the presence of certain facts
or doctrines which form a leading feature in the Scrip-
ture. Without going as far as the ingenuity of some has
carried them, in tracing the origin of almost every fable to

in different parts of the world, practise it to this day. Ac-
counts of the deiuge are preserved among the traditions of
the civilised Chinese, as well as among those of the wander-

strongly impressed upon the Greeks, in the shape of the
furies, and among the Celtic nations under the name of god-

of an evil spirit, is the leading feature in the Hindoo worship
of Seva, and in those evil genii, which are the objects of
terror and at the same time of worship in most savage
countries. Nor are there wanting, among the darkness of
these superstitious, prophetie legends of a brighter futurity,
