6 CHARLES THE TWELFTH.

Would it were thus! Ο would that we might win
No other presage of the soul within !

But that bright eye hath glauces too intense,
Too full, methinks, of storrn and turbulence ;
Behind the silence of those features lie
Unwakened thoughts, a voice, a prophecy:

The hour is nigh-yet ltere, thou Conqueror wild
Dream on for ever, be for ayo a child!

Again Ι saw that face erewhile so fair,

So bright in boyhood-—but a change was there ;
A change of soul and aspect—many a storm

Had swept in anger o'er his manly form,

And darkened round his exile3 childhood’s gleam
Was now no more than a sorgotten dream ;

The prophecy fulfilled‚ a history now

Had traced its charact’ry on that stem brow:

Say whence this tale of woe? alas! too well
Thou dread Pultowa! it is thine to tell.

Lo ! o'er thy battle plain another day,

In silence fleeting from the world away!
Another eve, and hush'd each living breath,
Mute Nature sorrowing o’er the field os death l
For through that silence on that lingering light
Fun many a sou] must wing its last long ssight!
There on the cold earth 'neath the cold night sky
They sink together, soes with soes to die:

No hand to aid, no voice of kindness near,

To fall in music on their dying ear,
