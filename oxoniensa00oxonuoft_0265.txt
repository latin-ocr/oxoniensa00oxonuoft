THE CHINAID. 29

And having left the patchwork² of the quilt,

The joyous work, and revelry of youth,

Do fiercely howl with yells insatiate.

But Ι prefer the melancholy doom

Of those departed, as befitting theme.

O, now the land of pepper'd China mourns,
Chingyang led forth, My stare! and Chingyang lost,
Chingyang did rule his Junks most haplesslyl

Ο, why was Keshin not at the command,

Belov’d of all, a great Toxopholite 'l ³

Our junks like rigg’d, and like grotesquely smear’d,
Convey'd our soldiers and the brave ⁴marine5

These junkS, ye planete all, destroyed them!
Chingyang himself, as by report we hear,

Did scarce meander through the realms of Choosh3
While they first doom'd, alas, around Amoy

Do lie in heaps considerably piekl’d !

O shriek‚ and ecrateh‚ aye, scratch your nasale all,
And bellow all a beastly brutal cry,

While they are rack’d, and mangl’d by the fish,
The voieeless tenauts of the briny waste.

² Patchwork] Nanzi remarks, that the Chinese could only have
been tyros in thiu “conjunction of particles,'' as the Emperor has
lately been presented with a tea-um mg, worked in ‘⁴ Berlin wool‚” ⁵
the subject being “ a group of Polar beare.''
’ ³ Toxopholite] It would seem that the Chiuese also have these

societies, which are generally interpreted as ‘⁴ The Bow and Arrow-
shooting at a mark—Clubs.''
