THE CHINAID. 19

What warrior's dead, and whom of Mandarins
Must mourning greet, and who by dying left
His opium-box without a master?

MESSENGER.

Chingyang himself doth live and see the light.

CAsnGAR.

Great light indeed thou say'st to regal homes,
A brilliant day from out a murky night!

MESSENGER.

Chonkou‚ the leader of the Tartar host,

On shore of Tosiang degraded lies;

While bulky Quang a musket-ball hath sent

With agile bound from out his crazy Junk3

And brave Sayansk, e’en sprung indeed from Nor,
The sea-girt isle of Songari frequents;

Balkash, Shahi, and eke a noble third,

With thicken'd skulls rebut the shores that rear
Old Mistress Cary's inauspicious brood.⁵
Squishsquash, that neighbour'd on the streame of Ho,
Tsanpo, and Ling, at once fell overboard ;

While Chingonou, with misen-able death,

⁵ Mistress Cary's brood] Sailors have a superstition about these
birds, that they ase omens of ill. “ Mother Cary'' has no connection
with ‘⁴ Mother Reda-sp? aa the learned Crachshawsh supposed.
