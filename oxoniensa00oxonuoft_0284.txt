Caunus.

Our prowess maimed !

Came-nno.

My fatted escort gone!

Cnonus.

Those loving friends all sunken in the deep.

Cumanae.

Come, Mandarins, come, toddle ye to home.

Caenus.
Hooroosh ! What Ho !

Cumanae.

Aye, howl in loud response.

Cnonus.

A wretched boon of wretches to a wretoh.

Cmnonuo.
Hollah! Baloo! Do wail aloud, Ι say.

Cnonus.

We do, my liege, as loud as soreeching owls.

Cmnmmno.

Come, smite your breasoe, and pummel them all o’er!
