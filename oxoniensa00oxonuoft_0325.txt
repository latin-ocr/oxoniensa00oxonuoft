ἒ it unchristian for a man to choose his country as a peculiar
ἔ object of his affections? It will not lead him to hate other
Ἴ countries: indeed the truest Patriots will generally be found
ἱ ” to be most liberal in their love to their fellow-creatures.

The many advantages of a patriotic spirit might now be
³ treated of3 its prevalence over majestic mountains and fertile
plains, the thick forest and the heathery prairie, the heats
of a tropical clime and the icy torpor of the poles. Exam-
ples might also be sought in the mirror of history,· and with
regard to almost every country, on almost every page of their
history, whether of war or peace, we should find some dis-
* play of the spirit of Patriotism. But time and space forbid
ι us to go into these particulars, they are so extensive that
they would never end3 there is not a region, yea, we may
almost say, there is not a spot of earth where human foot
e’er trod, upon which this guardian angel has not smiled ς

“ The shuddering tenant of the frigid zone
Boldly proclaims the happiest spot his own,
Extols the treasures of his stormy scas,
And his long night of revelry and ease;
The naked savage, panting at the line,

ζ Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine,

¹¹ Basks in the glai-e, or stems the tepid wave,
And thanks his gods for all the good they gave;
Nor less the pati-101: boasts, where'er we roam,
His first, best country, ever is at Home.’'
