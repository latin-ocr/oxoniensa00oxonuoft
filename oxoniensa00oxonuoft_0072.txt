8 CROM-WELL.

An inurar-d light, that, with its stret-ming ray,
On the dark current of his changeless day
Bound all his being with a silver chain—
Like a swist river thro’ a silent plain !

High thoughts were his, when by the gleaming

flood‚

With beart new strung, and stem resolve, he stood3

Where rode the tall dark ships, whose loosen’d sail

All idly ssutter’d in the eastern gale;

High thoughts were him—but Memory's glauce the
while

Fell on the oherish'd past with tem-ful smile3

And peaceful Joys and gentler thoughts ewept by,

Like summer lightnings o’er a darkon'd sky.

The p‘eace of childhood, and the thoughts that roam,

Like leving shadows, round that childhood’s home3

J oys that had come and vanish'd, half unknown,

Then slowly brighten’d, as the days had flown ;

Years that were sweet or sad, hecalm'd or toss’d

On life's wild waves—the living and the lost.

Youth stain'd with follies: and the thoughts of ill

Crush’d, as they rose, by manhood’s sternet will.

Repentant prayer-s, that had been strong to save—

And the first sorrow, which is childhood's grave !
