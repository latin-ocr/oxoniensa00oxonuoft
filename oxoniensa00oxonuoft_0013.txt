THE SANDWICH ISLANDS. 9

Of these we know not, for the march of time

’ Pass’d unrecorded in that drowsy clime-

Lull’d in the haven of a calm repose,

Exempt from dangers, and seem-’d from foes,
Supinely blest, no wants—no cares had they
Beyond the cravings of the passing day3

Enough for them that Nature’s bounty pour’d
Her wealth around tllem,—an exhaustless hoard ;
For sustenance they neither sow'd or till’d,

Or sought it but as wayward nature will’d:

Year after year, in that sweet solitude‚

They saw her boon of summer fruits renew’d,
Wateh’d the sost Uru's⁸ golden rind expand‚

'rin the ripe meal hung ready to their hand3
Stripp’d from the Auti’s9 bau-k their warp and woof,
Found in the palm's dark leaves a graceful roof;
Or where the Cocoa’s husky fruits decline,
Drank from its cup their unsermented wine.
Lords of those happy lands, where plenty yields
Spontaneous harvests from uncultur’d fields,

For them the beasts upon the mountains stray'd,
For them the wild fowl throng’d the forest glade;
’Twas theirs to snare the songsters of the wood,
To net the scaly tenants of the flood,

⁸ ‘⁶ Uru‚'' the native name of the celebrated bread fruit.
