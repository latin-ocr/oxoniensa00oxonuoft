tenance of AEschylus, it is said, betrayed the greatest ferocity

Time and space, however, warn us that we must now
pass to the consideration of Sophocles, the second of the

regularly for the stage. Sophocles was early distinguished
not only as a poet, but also as a general. In several battles
he shared the command with panant, and exercised the office st
of Archon with prudence and wisdom ; he was greatly be-
loved by the people, who eagerly applauded the noble rival-
