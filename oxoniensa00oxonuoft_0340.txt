We are told that, at the exhibition of a play, in which he
severely censured some superstitious of the populace‚* they
were so enraged at his temerity‚ that he would have been
stoned to death, had not his brother Ameinias exhibited his
arm, wounded at the fight of Salamis. “ An anecdote,” says Ι
Major, “ which at once demonstrates their ferocity and their ’ἕ
magnanimity.” The military daring and personal courage of ³
AEschylus have given to his plays a 'boldness and vigour of co-
louring, nearly unknown in the writings of his rivals. Sopho-
cles accused him of writing only when inebriated; but his
pictures, though often times exaggerated, do not exhibit those
signs of confusion which must necessarily attend the composi-
tions of such a time. AEschylus taught his plays to the chorus
with a degree of precision seldom attempted by other tragic
writers ; he did not indeed, act himself,† but he never per-
mitted the intervention of a master. The ingenuousness of
AEschylus is apparent from the acknowledgment, “ that his
tragedies were but scraps from the magnificent repasts of
Homer.” The story of his being killed, by atortoise dropping
upon his bare head, is probably only a fable‚ emblematical
perhaps, says a learned writer, of his genius and decay. He
died, from whatever cause, in the first year of Ol. lxxxi.
1³.c.456.‚ in the seventieth year of his age. Schlegel says
of him, “his characters are sketched with a few bold and
strong touches: his plots are simple in the extreme ς he did
not understand the artos enriching and varying an action,
and of giving a measured march and progress to the com-
plication and deuouement. Hence his action often stands
still; a circumstance which becomes yet more apparent from
the undue extension of his choral songs. * ⁶ ⁸* ¹* Terror

expressions of an impioufl tendenoy in one of his dramas.
