14 CHAROES THE TWELFTH.

Paused on the threshold of the western sky,
Lingering at sunset as though loth to die ?

E'en such a gleam—-so fleeting and so sair,

One moment lightened Sweden’s long despair,
One moment woke his widow’d realms to sing
Strains of high welcome for their long-lost king ;
How soon to cease! how soon shall tears be shed‚
And requiems chanted for the warrior dead!

Athwart the vault of midnight deep-and lone

Τὴθ Arctic winter deeper gloom had thrown3
Night's heavenly wardens, with unsleeping eye,
Kept watch along the battlements on high

Above the slumbering world, while darkness fell
On leaguring host and leagured citadel.

But one there slumbered not, one lawless will
still dreamt of strife, tho’ earth would fain be still,
still dreamtofstrife-but hush l he dreams no more-
There rung his knell, the life-long conflict o'er !
E’en like a wayward child with sleep opprest,
Sinking at day—fall on its mothel-’s breast,

Earth's strongest son, her tempest-child of might
Lies hushed for ever in the arms of night.

O! ask not now if retribution just

Taught the proud Swede dominion is but dust—
If it was well that kings should leam, though late,
The hopes and scats of man to venerate.

O turn we rather from his wild career

To gaze with awe upon his silent bier,
