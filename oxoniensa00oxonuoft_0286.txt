Oui· eyeballs redden with our hearty ory-

Cumou'uo.

Move on, away, come toddle on tow'rds home.

Cnosius.
Hollah! Baloo! Hooroosh! This fated land!

’ cumeum.

Ο cease to bellow as ye slink along.

Caenus.

cumanae.

Ah, me! for those th'at perish’d in the junks !

Cnonus.

I’ll be thy escort with a far-fetched sigh ! !!⁵

⁵ Sigh] It is now maintained ¹ by all good critice, that this
“ heaving” (no connection with ceals) cometh from the chest, and not
from the pit of the stomach. 1 do not see that it militates against
the supposition‚ that ‘⁴ that thing of sighs‚'‘ IEneas, must have been
accompanied with a pocket fo'rce-pump.

FINIS.
