In the masterly drama of ‘⁴ Cato,'' we have a character
delineated the very reverse of the class of men just mentioned, ’
a character who considers Honour as a fine imaginary notion,  
that leads astray young inexperienced men, and draws them
into real mischief, while they are engaged in the pursuit of a ’,
shadow. The objections to Honour, on this score, may with '¹
fairness be adduced against those who in their notions have .
exceeded all bounds of reason; but against the moral and
elevating influence which true Honour has upon man, they
are powerless; for what, that is proved to support Virtue,
can be either imaginary or delusive?

In these remarks, we have glanced at some opinions con—

Δ cerning Honour, and from what has been said, this seems to

p'resent itself as a fair conclusion: that when Honour has
Virtue for its foundation, and is not at variance with the laws
of God, there is no bond of society that ought to be more
cherished and encouraged ; but when our notions concerning
it are contrary to all religious and virtuous principles, it is
one of the greatest hanes to the human race, inasmuch as it
gives to what is false and unsound the appearance of what
is good and laudable.

THE LEGEND OF LLANGORSE.

Lnrn the sands of the sea are the legends of Wales,

But connects with itself some tale of the place.
Sometimes, if you ask but the name of a cmg,

You are told that Llewellyn there planted his flag,
