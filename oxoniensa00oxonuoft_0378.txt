Ο Vmws, queen of Paphos,

And Gyprus' sunny isle,
Quit, quit thy Carian temple,

And, deeked with many a smsse,
Haste to the incense-bearing shrine,
Where, clothed in pensive loveHness,
Fair Glycera destroys my peace,

Refusing to be mine.

Bring Cupid with his quiver‚

And every wauton Grace
And laughing nymph, with pleasure

Imprinted on her face,
And Youth‚ without thee fair in vain,
And all persuasive Eloquenee ;
Come, free my breast from sad suspense,

Ο hasten to the fane!
Μαθητης·

Ο ασΕΕΝ of Paphos and Gnidus,
Despise your well beloved Cyprus.
Dispense your favours fair between us,
And hither come, my “ lubly Wenus.”
And let that chubby little chap

Come hither also on your lap ς

Bring too, your humble servant prays,
The ladies with their loosened stays ;
Quicksilver too, with lovely Hebe,

More charming than the queen of Shebe.

Tmornr Cunnum.
