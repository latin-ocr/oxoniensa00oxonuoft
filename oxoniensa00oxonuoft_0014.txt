10 THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.

Or guided by the ton-ch, at close of day,
In dusky shallows to transflx their prey.

Yet light these labours,—for they lest them free,
To rove, as fancy will’d, o'er land and sea,—
To wander through the pathless wood‚-to lave
Their swarthy limbs in stream or crystal mave,—
To dash in sport amid the blinding suff,—
To thread the danee upon the moon-lit turf,—-
At morn to twine their hair with dewy flowers,
With song and jest to wake the drooping hom-s,—
At noon to seek beneath the Aoa’s boughs‚
A screen from heat‚——a shelter for repose.¹⁰
Thus by no loftierjoys or hopes inspir’d‚-—
Urg‘d by no wants,—by no ambition fir’d,
The current of their being pass'd away,
Like the still waters of the coral bay,¹¹
Scarce ruffled by the blasts whose fury hurl'd
Conflicting tempests o’er a troubled world.

¹⁰ For this description of the mode of living in the Islands, reference
maybe again made to the Polynesinn Researchew-For their methodu
of hunt-ing and fishing, more especially by torch lighg—their frequent
bathing, and the nee of flowers in the decoration of their persons,

thatching their houses, vol. i. c. 7. The amusement of ewimming in
the surf, &c. is described, vol. iv. c. 14.
