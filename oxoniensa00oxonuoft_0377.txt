Ο Vanus, queen of Cyprus' isle,
Thy well-loved Paphos leave,
And come to Glifton, calling thee

Its lovely air to breathe.

Ο bring with thee the fervid boy
And nymphs withhfiowing gowns,

The Graees too, with rosy cheeks‚
Like those on Durdham downs.

Here in the temple built for thee

The frankincense shall rise,
And with a cloud the place shall fill
Like steam from mutton pies !

Bms‘rommms.

Vanus Regina! haste and come

Unto the Glycerean home3

Come in a train, and don't delay,

Come with your train of N ymphs this way.
And Mercury too
Must come with you,

Come to enjoy a bright holiday.
What Horace says is,

Let all the Graces
With beautiful faces,
Your little son also,

And Youth with curls false oh!
Haste hither with thee, and set up their sway.

TmmomAnus.
