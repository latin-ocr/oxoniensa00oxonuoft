Of all the past, no image filled his eye,
But J acob’s blessing—Esau’s bitter cry 2-
He bar’d his sword!--On that unnatural day

A curse came down when Israel turn’d away.

Years sped their course: the fierce Chaldean came,

And Salem’s walls were wrapt in robes of flame:
Fair Zion’s height with camage all o’erspread;

Her temple fallen, and its glory fled:

And thou wert there! with unrelenting brow

The first to slay——the first to triumph, thou& !
Foremost to hurl the blazing brand ¹¹, and fill

The festive cup on Zion's holy hini!

Could none be found but thee? Could wrath divine
Be dealt on J udah by no hand but thine ,Ρ

8 ⁴‘ For thy violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall
cover.thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever. .. .In the day
that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners
entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou
wast as one of them. But thou shouldest not have looked on
the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger3
neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of J udah
in the day of their destruction3 neither shouldest thou bave
spoken proudly in the day of distress-...Neither‘ehouldest
thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did
escape‚'' &o. Obadiah v. 10—14.

'¹ “ The Temple which the Edomites bumed when Judaea
was. made desolate by the Chaldees.'’ 1 Esdr. iv. 45.

¹ ‘⁴ As thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee. . . .for as

ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall‚’' dac. Obadiah
v. 15, 16.
