'th the conquered tribes by teaching them the useful arts he
fred brought from Egypt, probably not without insinuations
ρ at the expulsion of Sesostris was a task that might be, with-
,Ῐι ·t much difficulty, accomplished by united effort ς that Se-
·stris, conceiving a hatred of him and his measures, or-
⁸÷ ered him to be confined at Colchos, under the care of AEeton
“ cupbearer. There are also tales narrated of Zeus, which
ζ e derived from Minos, the king of Crete, so celebrated for
³ “ justice.

. Nor is Zeus the only deity who possesses a real historical
,κι macter. Hermes or Mercury appears to have been a
31 'ghly cultivated prince, remarkable for eloquence, and fond
fif the arts and literature. He appears under three different
’ἓ aracters—chief secretary of Osiris, treasurer of Egypt, and
ommissioner of funerals 3 and hence his three names, Ar-
35¹· ais or Hermes, Mero-heres, signifying merchandize, whence
* ·e Latin Mercurius, and Pluto or Aidoneus, under which
.. ‘tle he is represented as king of Hades. His kingdom was
y the Ceraunian mountains and the Acherusian lake, and
³¹⁴ residence at Orcus was in the midst of stagnant pools,
·arshes, frightful dells and caves, rivers black and chilling
iemps, replete with every object of mysterious dread and
2loomy horror 3 and there is a report that it was hence that
'²² omer drew his picture of Tartarus

Horus or Apollo also is a two-sold character, and his more
legant features are referred to Apollo, brother to Diana;
hile his more ferocious actions pass under the name of
Mars. Python or Neptune was the admiral of Osiris; Her-
cules was the general of the land forces, though two other
individuals have contributcd to the legends related of this
wonderful character. Ceres is the same as Isis, the Egyptian
:¹ . ne of the wife of Sesostris. Minerva was the queen of
he Amazons, of whom another appellation is Medusa (Με-
, ιουσα), a Greek version of the Egyptian title. Remarkable
