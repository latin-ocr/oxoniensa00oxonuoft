6 BATTLE OF THE NILE.

Unhappy Brueysl Oh, might valour save,
Franoe had not wept above thine honor-’d grave ;
Thy memory had not wreath'd one oirclet more
For the rich crown victorious Albion wore !

It might not be. Lo, through the gloom of night,
The ruthless flames wave high their lux-id light,
Sport like fell demens through the crackling shrouds,
And mock the fury of yon palsied crowds.
Stay, moi-tals, stay l your feeble efforts spate,
A foe more dread, a mightier arm is there ;
In blazing tracery hung from mast to mast,

The wreathed flames their vivid lightnings cast3
Far o’er the gleaming ocean’s erimson'd wave,

Like sabled death-lights pointing to the grave;

Far o'er the erowds that throng around to gaze,
O’er friends, o'er foemen, streams the mighty blaze 3
Till the vast fabric, leaping from the sea,

Rent with her throes of death-straught agony,

High through the air upheaves her giant frome,
And falls in thousand wrecks-a cataraot of fleme Ξ*

⁴ “This tremendous explosion was followed by a silence not less
awful: the firing immediately ceased on both siden and the first
anund which broke the silence was the dash of her shattered masta
and yards falling into the water from the vast height to which they
had been exploded.”—Southey'⁸ Life of Nehon.
