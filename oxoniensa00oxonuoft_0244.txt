8 THE CHINAID.

As were Loochoo, Yangoo, and Kianghi‚
Tho' Kings of King the mighty subalterna,
And on they rush, inspectore of the force
Those match-look wielders, mounted too on steeds
Most dread to view, and terrible in fight
Through ster-n resolve and hardihood of soul.
Shantung, delighter in narcotie weed,

And Yunnanfoo, dead shot at sixty yards‚
With brave Honan, and Kiangsee that drove
His father’s kids along with Tchekiang.

But others, too, Whang Hai, or Hoang Ho,
Of bounteous flood hath sent brave Singanfou,
Stream-nurtur'd son of kindly Yang-tse·Kang,
And he who rules Mitschou‚ the noble Tong.
With Soung, inspector of the ancient Si,

All mat-shy men, and nei-vous pluoky oars

Of cranky junks3 in countless multitude
Then follow next the delicate Mantohoos

'rhat sway the continent, whom ruling kings
Sangkoi and Lin, with opium-eating Yang,
Turn out in “ spioy traps” and ‘⁴ drags of four,”‘-'
A fearful sight for freshmen to behold.

Out pour the neighbours of the sacred Chiu,
Quangsee and Yalong‚ anvils of the ἐρεᾶν,

To ward a British yoke of slavery

2 Drags of four] Hogh and Blundermiihl (valde inepte) would
read “cars of eight ;” but the passage only shews that the Chinese
must have universities.
