ehold a nation whom we have honoured as the sages of the
world—when we see their heroes blinded by the most puerile
superstitious, their philosophers following the grossest deities,
their poets upholding the most absurd fabrication of lies3
when we find the whole nation, for centuries, surrendered to
the power of such a baneful religion, with scarce a spark of
,light glimmering amidst all the gloom 3 is it not enough to
{cause us to exclaim, with the deepest horror, Are these the
{classic geniuses whom we have so admired, and is this all

’ἱ Mournful as is the consideration, it is no less true 3 and at
{the same time, we may render it useful, by tracing the dif-

been founded. There have been hardly any unenlightened
nations which have not possessed systems of superstition pe-
culiar to themselves. The difficulty in writing upon them is,
not to find matter, but to confine it within a reasonable
space: as we would not be tedious, we shall abridge our
introduction, and we hope the illustrations, we shall presently
have to adduce, will be sufficiently interesting. In a classical
institution, our chief attention must be given to the Greeks
and Romans3 not, however, to the neglect of other *nations
First then, as to the cause of superstition. We believe
religion to be a system based on the present, and looking to
the future. [f the present was all that concerned man, he
