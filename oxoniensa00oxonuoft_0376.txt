VARIOUS TRANSLATIONS OF HOR. OD. Ῑ. 30.

Ο QUEEN of Paphos, leave thy home
In Cyprus' flowery isle,

And come to Glycera's shrine at Rome,
To grace it with thy smile.

And with thee bring thy roguish boy,
But not without his darts,

And in thy train the Graces coy,
And all thy loving hearts.

Tmo.

CARIAN queen of amorous guile,

T hy sway the Paphians own,
Cyprus is thy lovely isle,

And Cythera thy throne ;
Fairer yet thy home shall be

Where shines my peerless Glycera ;
Sweeter perfume welcome thee,

If thou wilt only kiss her, ah !

Carian mother of Eros,
Descend with all thy suite 3
Every Grace, whose mautle flows
In waves around her feet ;
Youth and Eloquence may come,
And fondly sigh to kiss her, ah!
Youth and Eloquence were dumb
Without the smile of Glycera.

S'rm- Nomms Unam.
