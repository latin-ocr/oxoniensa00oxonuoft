There a resolute band, with their prime, at a blo'w‚

· Oft routed completely their numerous foe.

Or again, a grim cavern will tell you a tale,

The recital of which would make your heart quail ς
There dwelt in that eave, in the good time of old,
Bands of robbers, who plundered the land, you’re told 3
But of all the famed legends from lands of the Norse,
Not many will equal the Tale of Llangorse.

That water, whose face now reflects the last ray
Of the sun as it sets at the close of the day,
That lake, which appears so glassy and still,
Has a legend to tell, that with horror would fill
Any heart that is not as hardened as steel,

Any heart that for other’s misfortunes can feel.
For in place of that water, which covers the land,
A neat little town did formerly stand ;

On this side and that was happiness seen,

And itself was the picture of neatness, Ι ween.
'rhen why this reverse to its primitive state?
Why, you’d ask, did it meet so untimely a fate 2
Not many years back that town was so gay,
The bells of its chureh had been ringing all day,
In each little cottage was mirth to be seen,

And before it were danoes kept up on the green.

Not far from the town, on the brow of a hill,
stood a castle, whose ivy clad ruins are still

, To be seen, though their time-honoured glory is past,

And the fame of their lords no longer may last.
This castle belonged to a baronet proud,

’ Who with wealth and with honbur was richly endowed,

And now he was seen elate with his pride,
For he’d lately returned with a beautiful bride ε

’Twas for her that the bells had been ringing away,
