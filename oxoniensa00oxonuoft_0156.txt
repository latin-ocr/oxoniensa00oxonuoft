24

“ Remember, Lonn‚”-the mourusul captives cried
As sad they wept by Babel‘s willowy side ⁸,—
“ O Loun, remember, in that hour of woe,
How tauntiug Edom prov’d our deadliest soe!’'
And that sad plaint‚ to Heav’n's high throne upborne,
Tho’ all that heard it curl’d the lip with scorn,
Call'd down the wralh which spake from many a lyre³
In strains that blasted like the breath os fire:
And the wild winds the accents swept along,
Til] Edom’s cliffs reechoed to the song.
On cold high heatts at first that waxning fell,
For Edom held his wind-rock’d citadel:
From Petra’s cliff look’d forth in impious pride,
And Zion’s wrath and Zion's Gon defied.
Then spake a voice—“ Altho' thou build thy nest
High as the stars;—and on the mountain’s breast
Sitt’st brooding like the eagle 3—yet My srown
shall hurl thy glory and thy greatness down¹:

k “ By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down, γεὸ, we
wept, when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harpe
upon the willows ...... Remember, O Lom), the children of
Edom in the day of Jerusalem3 who said,' Base it. ruse it,
even to the foundation thereof.'’ Psalm cxxxvii. 1, 2, 7.

¹ See Jerem. xlix. 16. and the quotation from the prophecy
os Obadiah prefixed to the poem.
