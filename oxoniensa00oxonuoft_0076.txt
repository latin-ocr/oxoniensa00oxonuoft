12 OROMWELL.

What forms are these, that with complaining sound,
And slow, reluctant steps are gethei-ing round?
Forms that, with him, shall tread life’s changing

stage,

⁸ Cross his lone path, or share his pilgrimage.

There, as he gazed, a wond'rous band—they came,

Pym's look of hate, and Strafford's glauce of fleme.

There Laud, with noiseless steps and glittering eye,

In priestly gerb, a frail old man, went by.

His drooping head bowed meekly on his breast3

His hands were folded, like a saint at rest!

‘There Hampden bent him o'er his saddle bow,

And death’s cold dews bedimm’d his eal-nest brow.

Still turn'd to watch the battle—still for-got

Himself, his sufferings, in his country’s lot!

ε There Falklaud ey’d the strife that would not oense,

Shook back his tangled looks, and murmur'd—
“ Peace !’'

With feet that spum’d the ground, lo! Milton there

Stood like a statue 3 and his face was fair-—

Fair beyond human beauty3 and his eye,

That knew not earth, soar'd upwards to the sky!

“‘His head bending down, and his hands testing on hin horse*-
neck, he was seen riding from the fieldf—-Loni Nuyent'e Memoria&
ofHampden, ii. 435.

Ι “ln his clothes and habit, which he had mindod besem always
with more nemnem and industry, he was now. not only inem-ivus.
hut negligent.''—Clarendon.
