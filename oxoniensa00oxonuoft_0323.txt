ἕ 11111 81181181, Patriotism' Put the question to Camillus,

or AEmilius Paullus, what induced the one to come with

3 unexpected succour to his ungrateful countrymen, what en-

ξ they will reply 111 united acclaim,Patriotism !

of a sanatio, too often construed into sincerity 3 but a firm
conviction of the judgment, founded on impartial investi-
