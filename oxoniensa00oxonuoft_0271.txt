‚Knsunm
What? How could bordes accomplish such a work?

Casama.

He got his bricks by contract, to be sure.

Knsmn.

Fulfilled it, too, and fortified Amoy‘?

CAsnGAn.

Aye, so; but gods had finger in the pie.

Knsmn.

Yea; mighty gods, that stultified my boy.

OAsuGAn.

So thus, you see, the matter how it stands.

Kusnm.

But how far'd they, o’er whom ye howl and cry?

CASHGAR.

The junks by sea did ruin us ashore.

Knsmx.

But were Immortals utterly destroy'd?

CAsuGAn.

Canton, methinks‚ goes dolefully and glum.
