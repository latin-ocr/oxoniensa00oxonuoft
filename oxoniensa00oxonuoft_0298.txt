The bosut of hernfflry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty‚ an that walth, e'er gave,
Await alike the inevitable hour; >

The pathe of glory lead but to the grave.

If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raiae,
Where through the long-drawn aiala, and fretted vaul
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise. ἶ

XI.
Can own-iod um, or animated huet,
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath3

Can honour'fl voice provoko the silent dunt,
Or flattery soothe the dull, oold ear os death!
