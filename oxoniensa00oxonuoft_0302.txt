16 ειεογ.

XV.

Some village Hampden, that, with dauntless breast,
The little tyrant os his fields withstood;
Some mute inglorious Milton heremay reim

Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.

XVI.

The applause of listening senates to command,
The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
To scatter plenty o'er. a smiling land,

And read their history in a nation's eye&

XVII.

Their lot foi-bade: nor circumseribed alone
Their growing virtues, but their crimes confinod;
Forbade to wado through slaughter to a throne,
And shut the gates of mei-oy on mankind3
