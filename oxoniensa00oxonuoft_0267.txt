THE CHINAID. 31

, The fragrant fruit of olive is at hand,
With verdant crop of ever-blooming leaves,

Δ, With child of earth, a woven daisy crown.

s But, O belov'd‚ come tip the star-s a stave,

³ And summon forth the deity, Keshin,

⁸ While I do pour these off’rings on the earth.

Cflonns.

O, royal lady, glory of Chinese‚

s Do thou expend thy honours on the ground,

But we will howl in concert to the sky,

2 And beg a gracious favour of the star-s.

⁹ Ye Seven Realms, and potentates of air,
Hiimboog‚ and Sfflgsong, deified of all,

, Send down a hero to the globe below.

ε Does, then, the bless’d, the monarch, and a god,

ν E'en hear our plaint‚ aye, most barbaric row,

Yell’d forth aloud in tones diversified'?

And shriek‚ I will—Dost hear, I say, up there?
But thou, Myhei, and other lords of blue‚

Ο grant our pray’rs, eonvey this mighty man,
Pekin-begotten liege of Chinamen!

O send him down, for ne’er alack I trow

Was land of China so beser. with “ mumps.''

ὑ

Ο, Boohooshing, send down, thou Boohooshing,
Keshin‚ I pray, as Emperor Keshin.
