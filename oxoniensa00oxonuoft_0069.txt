CROMWELL.

Schmcklich ist es, deiner Wahrheit
sterblichen Geffiss zu seyn-
Scflunnn-

ζ Hmn fate is their's‚ ye sleepless wama, whose ear

ἶ· Lem-ns Freedom’s lesson from your voice of sear ;

Ξ Whose spell-bound sense from childhood's bour bath
ζ known

ἶ Familiar meanings in your mystic tone:

ξ Sounds of deep import-voices that beguile

ξ Age of its tears and childhood of its smile,

ι To yearn with speechless impulse to the free

And gladsome greetings of the buoyant sea!

ᾗ ⁸High fate is their's‚ who where the silent sky

ρ Stoops to the soaring mountains, live and die;

Γ

ξ ⁸ This is in allusion ω the idea expressed in the twelfth of

‚. Mr. Wordsworth's Sonnets to Liberty :—
> ‘⁶ Two voices are there: one is of the sea,” &c-

⁷ eontrasting it with the fact of Cromwell's birth-place having been the
fen country of Huntingdonshire, where he lived till he was fort]
year· old.
