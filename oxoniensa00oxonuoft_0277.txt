When that most sage and opium-eating prinae,
The godlike Keshin, sway’d Celestial land !

And laws of science rul'd our grand attacks,

Nor turn'd his quid of opium in his jaws,

As were Kuehbang, Tumtum‚ and Fouchtifoo,
All sea-girt isles, and fortified so strong

With Chinese walls and skilful masonry.

Nor e'er did dine, before his brazen trump
Proclaim'd aloud his Mightiness had ‘⁶ done.'’
