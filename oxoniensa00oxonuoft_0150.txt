And hop’d, perchance, when Lise's gay round was o'er,
And joy and sorrow sway'd their hearts no more,
Their faithful souls, unfetter'd, yet might dwell
Amid the haunts they lov'd in lise so well !
And Petra thus had rear'd another tace
In turn to revel in her pride of place:
Thus the old eagles os imperial Rome
Seem'd on her hills to find a second home:
And Roman arts with Roman arms arose,
To blot the mem’ry of her former foes.
Tho' Edom’s line, by Ishmael's¹ sword opprest,

Had long been exil'd from their rock-built nest,

On Edom's rugged hius, as loath to set,

The sun of bygone summere linger-'d yet ε

stmetures,-chiefly for the dead. The most striking feature
of the place consiste, not in the fact that there are occasionai
excavations and sculptures like thone above described ς but in
the innumerable multitude of such exeavations, along the whole
extent of perpendiculai⁸ rocks adjacent to the main area, andin
all the lateral valleys and chasms; the enti-annes of very many
of which are variously, richly, and often fantastically decoruted,
with every imaginable order and style of architectum-'⁷
Robinson, ii. 629, 530. “ Indeed throughout almost every
quar-ter of this metropolis, the depositories of the dead muet
have presented themselves constantly to the eyes of the inha-
bitmta, and have almost outnumbered the habitatione of the ·
living.’' Irby and Manglee (quoted by Laborde.)
