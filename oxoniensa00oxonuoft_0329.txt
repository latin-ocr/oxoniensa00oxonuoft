And here from the solemn churchyard‚ the midnight ghosts
assemble,

In and out and round about, when the sooty ruins tremble-

No flowers but a few proud hollyhocks* adom the rude
perterre,

And the mignionette with odours spontaneous fills the air.

In that rude and grassy garden, at the dead of night are
heard

The wailings of the “ gheisten‚” the moans of the long in-
terred ;

Brave Robert, Lord of Berkeley‚ and Canynge of St. Mary's‚†

And many a sprite in the dead of night, dances and wails
with the fairies.

They mourn for old Bristowa‚ for the spell its spirit that
clogs 3

Hark ! hark! I hear their doleful cry, “ She’s going to the
dogs ! ''

N o ships on Avon bounding, no crowds through the city go ;

The gaping gates are open flung, but a. chain is sunk below.

But where are Bristol's heroes? they slumber at their posts ;

The sleepers sleep, and the weepers weep,—-the citizens and
the ghosts.

Ο citizens! Ο citizens! why will ye not awake? “

The mansions of peers fall about your ears, for the basements
shake, shake, shake.

The Fathers of the city, they sat till five o’clock,
About that famous hugbear‚ yclept a free port dock ;
.. And some declared it must be free, but others cried, “ Ο Sir,

'¹‘ “ Hast seen the rowe of holie oakes
In the swarde of the abbeye Ρ
There lyk a payre of lilies fayre
ξ My lite ll sister res twai e,.'&c Old Banad-

· †Brought hither for the occasio mwhether in air y ssight or through the
subterraneam passage is uncertain.
