68

Echo in the fairy grot
And in the rude wild, Atini;
Sound it each sequestered spot,
Ye rivers, whisper to the sea!
Tell it to the sighing trees,
Inscribe it in the loving sky,

Nature hymn thine obsequies!
For, Hellas, thou shalt die.

In the plain, and o'er the wave,
And on the islet meet the foe,
Conquer with the untrophied brave !
Their tomb shall then their glory grow.
Summon all the Roman's nerve,
And see the pit before thee lie ;
Mount the courser blind, nor swewe,
For, Hellas, thou shalt die.

Yes, I love thee as a child
ln lisping infancy that died-
Charming as it breathed and smiled‚
But when at placid eventide‚
Bathed in holy loveliness,
For ever closed its youthful eye,
“ Enough,'' I said, “ 1 now possess,
For thou shalt never die.”
