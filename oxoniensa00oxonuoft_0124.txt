8 BATTLE OF THE NILE.

O'er the strange sight Ambia’s desert chjkl

'rho roving Bedouin bends his glauces wilde
Though all unskill’d the Giaour’s stern fight to read,
How fares Britannia, how the Frenohmen speed3
Whilst fear and wonder dim their aohing gaze,

The Mamluko trembles‚ and the Arab prays.

Allah, give ear! Oh, thou that rul’st the fight,
Rise, God of battles, and defend the right!

Here be thy terrore once again display'd,
Here with dread portenta daunt the renegade Ψ

J oy to fair Egypt! bid new smiles illume
Her sadden’d brow, and chase oppression’s gloom3
Bid cheering hope, with nature's lavish hand,
Bless the bright soenes of that enehanted land!
Her green savannahs, sost as evening calm—
Her lotus-bede, and groves of feathery palm-
The emerald vet-dure that in Goshen grows-
The glist’ning olive, and the perfum’d rose.
Her lowliest spots with gilded memories spread—
'rents of the living—cities of the dead ;
Her ancient monuments, whose legende olimb
Like ivy tendrils round the trunk of Time ;

⁷ 77ae roneyade. It seems certain that the Egyptian· looked on
Napeoleon's conversion as mere imposture3 and therefore would
apply to him au the disgraoe of deserting hi· own religion, without
tho mdeeming virtue of adopting theim.
