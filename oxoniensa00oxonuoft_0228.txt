A LEGEND OF THE LATE 1LLUM1NAT10N1.

 

Pulsatus rogat et pugnis concisus adorat,
Ut liceat paucis cum dentibus inde revenh-hwa

PRE FACE.

Tun subject of the following tale is matter now of history,
Though shrouded, to avoid offence‚ in due poetic mystery ς
And 1 assure my readers all, in cottage or in palace, Sirs, ,
That, though I “nought extenuate,'' I “set down nought in malice, ,'
Sirs.

A tragi-comedy Ι sing—three “ grave and reverend signors.'’ ¹
Who sallied forth one luckless night, with dignified demeanours,
To send home all their college men, on pain of rustication,
Whom they found joining in the row, at last illumination.

For sundry graceless undergrads, with wine somewhat “promis-
Fronizzoolvzing bumpers to the Queen, (such power good port and
whiskey has.) ’
A gown-and-town row had got up, to testify their loyalty,
By milling of all rads and eads, and other foes to royalty.

At length the streets, at “noon of night‚” had grown a little quieter,
For one by one had dropp’d off home, each capless, gownless rioter3
On which our heroes satisfied‚ with this consoling knowledge, Sirs,

And thinking all their labours o’er, were hast’ning back to college, 2
Sira. i
