ELEGY.

I.

Tun oursew tolls the knell of ‚ parting day,
The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,

And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

ΙΙ.

Now fades the glimmering landsoape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,

Save where the beetle wheels his drony ssight,
And drowsy tinklings lull tho distant solda.
