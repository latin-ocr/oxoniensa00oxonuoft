CROMWELL. 11

The shout of onset and the shriek of sear

Smote, like the rush of waters, on his ear3

And his eye kindled with the kindling stay,
The surging battle and the mail’d array !

All wondrous deeds the coming days should see,
And the ‘long Vision of the years to be.

Pale phantom hosts, like shadows, faint and far,-

Ι couneus, and armies, and the pomp of war!

And one sway'd all, who wore a kingly orown,
Until another rose and smote him down.

A form that tower'd above his brother men 3

A form he knew—but it was shrouded then !

With stern, slow steps—unseen—yet still the same,
By leaguer’d tower and tented field it came 3

By Naseby's hill, o'er Marston's heathy waste,

By Worcester’s field the warrior-vision pass’d!
From their deep base, thy beetling cliffs, Dunbar,
Rmng, as he trode them, with the voice of war!
The soldier kindled at his words of fire3

The statesman quail'd before his glanae of ire!
Worn was his brow with cares no thought could scan3
His step was loftier than the steps of man 3

⁶ And the. winds told his glory—and the wave
Sonorous witness to his empire gave !

⁸* “It is just to say, that the maritime glory of England may first
be traced from the era of the commonwealth in a track of continuans
light.¹'—Hallam's Comi. Hist. ii.
