'Twas for her that the town had been merry and gay ;
But little she thought, in her bridal array,

'rhat the span of her life was confined to the day.

'Twas late on that night, when the bride had retired‚
And even the bridegroom had owned himself tired,

That the cry of alarm is heard thro' his halls,

Because water for miles had surrounded his walls.

Oh, heavens ἱ what anguish the villagers felt,

When death his dread darts so unsparingly dealt;

When each mother clasped wildly her babe to her brem,
And sunk ’neath the wave that had covered the rest!
How fearful her shrieks, which reached to the skies‚
How beart-rending the scream which she gives ere she dies!
And if, gentle reader, you visit that lake,

Restrain not the thoughts which the place may awake 3
But remember that, while o'er that water you row,

’Tis over the graves of the dead that you go.

Curuo.

NIOBE.

What is that form of snow
Upon the steep hill side?

’ Tis Niobe, sad child of woe,
Amphion's wretched bride.

Her tears for ever flow,
Cold is her marble form,
And icy is her lofty brow,
Bared to the winter’s storm.
