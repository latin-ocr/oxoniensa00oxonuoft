The lonesome
spirit's fellow-
demons, the
Examineres of
GRBAT—GO, take
part in his
office, and two
of them relate
one to the other

As they were wont to do;

In hopes to pass ouen-oo.

Along the streete full many a yard,
From the bottom of Beaumont Row

The spirit slid3 and it was he
That ruleth o'er onum-oo.

He sets the Latin that men must write,
To get them through enen-oo.

How long in this same sleep I lay,
I have not to declare3

Two voices in the air.

man '2
The deed my spirit grieves5
With his cruel hand in the enen-oo Schools
He tore the Amswowrn leaves.

“ The Spin-it who bideth by himself
At the bottom of Bcaumont Row,

For that he hath us’d the Amswon'ru leaves
He will pluck him for onan-oo?
