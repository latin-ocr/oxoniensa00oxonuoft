Scatters the briny drops of sun-lit spray

Over the coral rocks of ΜονοΙιιιιί.ι

Thus, as to musing thought these isles expand

In smiling contrast with our dark'ning strand,

They rise, as when night's shrouding pall whhdruwn,

Beat back tho envious billows' cireling soum,

And rose rejoicing in their Oce-an home.

Beautiful Isles! whose aer-y presence seems
To float before us in these waking dmams,
With what strange tales of Nature’s wondrous powers

Nor waiting till late ages should display
The growing isles that in her bosom lay,
