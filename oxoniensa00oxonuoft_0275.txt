THE CHINAID.

Knsmu.

¹ But, nay3 the force that fortified Amoy
Has not return’d‚ methinks‚ all safe and sound.

Cuonus.

How say'st? Not safe, those valiant Chinamen?

Knsnm.

«ξ But Just a sprinkling of those glorious men,
’ At least if we can all sure credence give

Το bulky gods “ Past‚ Present, and To Come.'’

-. And there they lie, where Hoang winds his stream,
’τ A good fat banquet to the greedy land,

A rich desert for folly and for pride,

To think that they could man their shaky jnnks,
Could plant their carmon and their rusty guns
- Against the roar of grand artillery.

They did their ‘⁴ tit,’' and got a precious ‘⁶ tat,''
But yet there's left the bottom of the cup,

A bitter draught to gall Immortal throats.

So great a cake of misery (not plums)

Is kneaded up, that taces three remov’d

Will see this voiceless monument of ill,

And (strange) will beg to be excus’d a slice.
For growing pride, that rears its head too high,
Is toppl'd down, and sure to have a fall.

O, seeing these memorials of ill,

Remember Britain and the Britishers‚
