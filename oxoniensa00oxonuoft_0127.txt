BATTLE OF THE NILE. 11

There first th' impatient urehin learnt to steer‘
His rude-built vessel, and forgot to fear3

There Nelson learnt to spui-n his idler home,

And the wild waters’ denizen to roam.

There from the village manse⁸ the brave boy flew
- The tide, the boats, the distant sails to view ;
Whilst home, its friends, its pleasures all forgot,
Wild Nature school’d him for his future lot 3

And taught, amidst the bluff winds’ rude embrace,
That ocean—love, no hardships may efface.

Caught with such love the veter-an rears his head,
The fearless young-ster pants the deek to tread 3 ’
So Britain’s sonS, the high, the lowly feel
One heartfelt sympathy with seamen’s zeal3
So he, the Poet‚ though untaught to glow
With that stern raptui-‘e warriors only know,

O'er his lone task, yet felt the generous pride,
Whilst fancy bore him to the hero's side,

And pati-iot ardour nerv’d his soul to write

The glorious story of Aboukir's fight—

Death ἶ thou eanst ne'er set seal to nobler fame,
Whilstvsadden’d memory whispers Southey’s name3

⁸ Nelwn's father was rector of the village of Burnham, on the
Norfalk coast.
