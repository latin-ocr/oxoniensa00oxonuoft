10 anRLEs THE Twnw'rfl.

Again his father-land before him lay,

Bright with the dawning os his early day3

And long may Sweden‚ srom her wave-worn steep,
Watch the mom kindling on the orient deep,

Ere such another o'er her hins and streams

Shall pour the promise of its rising beams.

Again the awakening voice of war is rolled
Onward from cliff to cliffi from hold to hold,

Tin hill and plain with every peasant's home,
From southern headland to the northern foam,
Have heard the mustering trump proclaim to men
A new Gustavus is on earth again!

Once more he listened, while the morning gale
Whispered of triumph through his swelling sajl;
Once more he kindles, while with eagle swoop
His banded hosts on cowering Denmark stoop,
And vows, as erst‚ amid the cannon’s roar,

This shall my music be for evermore⁵.

Then o'er him swept, as with a wing os flante,

All that awakes at N arva's deathless name,

And Dwina's flood before him rolled its ware,
Dark with the life-blood of the patriot bravo.
There Poland’s squadrons down the headlong stc-ep
Strong as a whirlwind to the onset sweep,

There Stenau's lance and Courland’s lordly plume⁶
Brighten the darkness of the battle gloom,

⁵ “This heneesorth shall be my music.” See Voltaire.
⁴⁵ Mareschal Stenau and the Duke of Cnurland led the Pale-u.
