direct path to true glory. Plutarch states, likewise, that
’ Honour was the only deity that the Romans worshipped
uncovered.

In the chivalrous ages, though hardly deified‚ the prin-
j' ciples of Honour were strained to a mad excess, and Romance
‚v has found many subjects for her tales in the deeds of Honour
‚4 then performed. But our endeavour should be, to arrive at
a conception of it more clearly defined than that which the
‚³ Romans worshipped, or the knights of old made the subJects
ξ”Ξ of perpetual encounters.
The philosopher holds Honour as parallel to Virtue; and
what deeds the man prompted by relig-lons feelings shuns,
f as contrary to the sacred law, the man of honour scoms as a
’ degradation to human nature. Both promote virtue ς but
from different motives. Religion embraces it as being en-
„⁴ joined by the Deity ε Honour, as being a graceful appendage
to man's being. We see, then, that though far inferior to the
, principle that directs the deeds of the Christian, as having a
moral influence upon man, Honour is not a thing to be made

light of ; and we may well say with Addison,
k “ Honour‘s a sacred tie, the law of kings‚

The noble mind's distinguishing perfeetiom

That aids and strengthens Virtue where it meets her,

And imitates her actions where she is not 3
It is not to be sported m'thf

. In high life, the notions of Honour are far from going hand

in hand with those of Virtue. But this kind of Honour, let
it be remembered, is but the abuse of Addison's definition
just quoted ; its laws are only regulated by those of fashion
and the way in which they are carried out, leads but to the,
commission of the most flagrant crimes‘ The most punc-
tilious attention to decorum in external deportment is re-
quired by them ; but in this the whole principle consists;
and, surely, men actuated solely by such motives, are not
to be counted among the true men of honour.
