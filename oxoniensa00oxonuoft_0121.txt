BA'I'TLE OF THE NILE. 5

On, on they prees, like falcone in the chace,

Eech would be soremost in the glorious mee!

Eaeh feels the gush of valour’s gener-oua tide,

Glows on each hardy eheek the warrior pride.

One prayer half whisper’d—but no eoward's cry,

One thought of home—but no reluctant sigb!

What though the foes their angi-y weleome fling,

Though wings of fleme the iron tempest bring !

Though crash the masto—though burst the sails in
twein,

And the thick grape-shot rends the whiten'd main 1-

Undaunted still, Britannia's heroes bide

The deadly storm, and seek the foeman’s side.

No useless gun,3 no hurried movement tells,

The spurious valour that Inaction quelle:

Till ehip with ship, till foe with foeman meets,

. And one dark wave upholds the hostile fleets.

Eaeh gun found utteranee then3 then burst the force
Of battle's tide—Oh ! who may stem its course?

Then Terror pray'd for life—what prayer shall speed'l
The death-shriek told its anguish—who shall heed'?

Then flow’d the blood-stream—whose the trickling
life ¹?
Then rung the war-shout—who hath gained the strife?

² None of the British ships returned a gun till they had taken
their several statione close alongside of the enemy's vessels.
