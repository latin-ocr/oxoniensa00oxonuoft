(And his rapt gaze in ecsiasy is bent¹

On what seems Pleasure’s mournsul monument.)

“ Ye deem the actor and his mimic rage

Pass'd like a shadow from you ruin'd stage ;

But to mine eye he lives and moves z—'tis we

Are shadows here—the substance only he!

Or do I dream P—-they come and fade so fast-—
Now here, now there—now present, and now past.
But now, a stem old king ¹³,-wh01n anguish strong
Had goaded into madness—-stalk'd along,

Sightless and crownless: . . . . now, a maidenq stands
Ev'n where he stood; and in her lily hands
Ensolds an urn: ineffable the grace—

The marble sorrow of that classic face !

It fades—’tis fied! . . . . and on a losty car

There sits another' z-like some balesul star

traveller on emerging from the terrific deffle which forms the
approach to Petra, is a ‘⁴ theatre, wholly hewn out of the live
roek. ....The cliffs on emh side are full of tombs; while in
front, along the face of the eastern ems, the eye of the spec-
tator rests on a multitude of the largest and most splendid
sepulchres. Strange oontrast! where a teste for the frivolities
of the day, was at the same time gratified by the magnificence
of tombs3 amusement in a cemetery 3 a theatro in the midst of
sepulchres.” Robinson, ii. p. 521, 522.
