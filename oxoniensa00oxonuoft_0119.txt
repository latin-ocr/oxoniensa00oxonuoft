BATTLE OF THE NILE.

, Tuon memory—haunted sea, to glory deur,

¹ Whose classic shores their (leathless fabrice rear;
Home of the free! thy conscious waves could tell
Of old Athena’s wooden citade13
Thy virgin waters nurs⁷d the infant sail
That venturous Tyre first trusted to the gale;
And thou hast listen’d to the Afric blast‚

Q}-

Whilst widow'd Carthago mourn'd her empire'past3

And Rome exulting could thine echoes ronse,

To the glad music of her laurell'd prows.
Lift thy proud waters ! rear thy glist'ning erest!
ἓ. For Albion’s warriors ride thy throbbing breast.
ξ Staunch as the oak that ribs their vessel's side,
ςἱ True as the compass, dauntless as the tide,
Eaeh h'eart beats worthy of their chieftain's fame,
Each soul is kindled with his soul of flame!
