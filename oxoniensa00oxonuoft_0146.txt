Not saintly grey—like many a minster sane

That crowns the hill οι· sanctifies the plain τ

But rosy-red¹,—as is the blush os dawn

Which first beheld them were not yet withdrawu:

The hues of youth upon a brow‘of woe,

Which men called old two thousand years ago !

Match me such marvel, save iu Eastern clime,—
{A rose-red city—half as old as Time!

And this is Petra—this the losty boast

Of Edom’s once unconquemble coast!

These the gay halis thro’ which, in days of old,

The tide of life so rapturously roll’d !

These the proud streets where Weahh, with lavish hand,

Pour’d the rich spoils of ev’ry Orient land3

All that the seaman's timid barque beguiles,

To Cush and Ophir, ‘ Tarshish and the Isles :⁹

Asrie’s red gold‚—Arabia's spicy sture,—

And pearl and plume from India's furthest shorem!

of this singular spot, is the colour of the rocks. They present
not a dead mass of dull monotonous red; but an endless variety
of bright and living haee, from the deepest crimson to the aoftest
pink.'’ Robinson, ii. 531. Irby and Mangles, and Laborde,
repeatedly notice the singular effect of the “ rose-ebloured
graniW’ of Petra.
