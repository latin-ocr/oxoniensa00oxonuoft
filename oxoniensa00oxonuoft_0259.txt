THE CHINAID.

Do keep the great celestial host “ a slaving.”
The night drew on, and yet no muffi'd oar
With stealthy stroke from Britisher was heard3
Until the morning, with her snowy steeds

In beauteous light, shed o’er the joyous earth,
From Britons first, a sbrill and ringiug sound
Did greet its echo, and a loud ‘⁴ huzza”

From rocky isle does e’en reverberate.

But sear on all the Chinamen did come

Of their intent so “ miserably sold ;'’

For not in flight did Britons raise that shout
Of cheering Paean, but in stul-dy soul

Did rush to battle, for the boatswain’s pipe
With searching whistle kindl’d up the flame-
And then in time they smartly “ bouted ship,”
In order “ seudded o'er the briny waste,'’

And ‘⁴ hove in sight” for all of us to view3

The right wing led, while second in the tier
The rest advane'd: nathless the shout we heard—'-
⁴‘ Huzza! my lade, for sweethearts and for wive83
Come, steady‚ boys, and cry again once more,
St. George! Old Enghmd, and for ever !'’
But, lo! a sputt’ring of the Chinese tongue
From us did greet them3 for, without delay,
Each ship on ship the grappling-iron flings.
And first in action was the Britisher3

who, pouring broadsides on our noble junks,
In di'ff'rent place did spoil their figure-heads.
