alone with two solemn personageS, whose occupatiori was to ,

study the clear heavens, which I now saw open above. There ι

multitudinous worlds revolved in unbounded space‚· there
suns shone with a dazzling brightness ς there light darted
along with inconceivable rapidity3 but the glane, the dizzy
whirl, and all the novel scene would have been too much for
me, had I not at that moment perceived that Ι was on the
summit of the temple, and at the same time seen an angel,
the fairest of the fair, issue from heaven above, with a bright
crown in her hand. That crown was destined for me, but in
over eagerness to grasp it, I fell from the giddy height, and
was awoke by receiving a severe blow on the crown which
my head already possessed; for in the moment of excitement
I had leapt out of bed, and fallen prematurely to the ground,
from which Ι rose with the convicti0n‚ that true learning is

η an interesting and a noble pursuit3 but that the crown can

only be obtained by diligence‚ patience, and perseverance.
