32

Unto the Holy Pope they went,
Who for a thousand eandles sent—-
But wax ones, you know, or else 'twas “ no go ’'—
Would grant them absolution !
The gallant knight of Glyglumgleagh‚
Who by his great fame had aequit-ed a name
That was known in all the west countrie,
Full oft in war would lead his men
Against the haughty Saraeen ;
And dealing death at ev’ry blow,
He'd madly rush upon the foe:
Foremost in rampart, ditch, and fosse
Was seen the brave count Blomonosse!
Elfaira, his lady, was handsome to view,
Accomplished, good—natured, and amiable too ;
Yet sometimes, alas! oh! it must be said,
Some fanciful whims would come into her head ;
In which, as is usual, she would have her way,
spite of all that Count Blomonosse could do or say.

[The Count joins the Crusade, and with the army eneamps
before J erusalem.]

'Tis mom ! the Crusade marches on ;

Both kings and princes, counts and knights, are there;
The bright sun throws his glowing beams upon
The banners, floating in the morning air:

Those dazzling helms, that bristling field of spears,
Rouse in the Sultan's mind his direst fears ‚·

'Tis Christian power against Heathen might,

’Tis Europe's forces with the Sultan’s fight ς

Each hand would rather die than suffer shame,
Would yield their lives for honour and for fame.
Their quiv'ring lances glitter from afan—

How truly grand—how beautiful is war! !
