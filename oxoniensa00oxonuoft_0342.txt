worship, each was followed by his particular friends and
admirers. Sophocles was far more effeminate than AEschylus.
He is reported to have danced naked round a trophy erected
to commemorate the victory of Salamis. Being possessed of ,
a handsome face and a graceful figure, he made himself more ⁴
agreeable to the darkeyed Athenian beauties than his rival
Euripides, hence, perhaps, arose his flattering pictures of l
