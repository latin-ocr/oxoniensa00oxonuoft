THE SANDWICH ISLANDS. ll

Such was their lot that imag’d forth the time

’ Of the world's insancy and golden prime,

‚ Had eri-ing nature that sure pathway trod

Ἴ That leads to happiness‚—-—that points to God.

But superstition's phantom gal-b array'd

Wild shapes that scal-'d them in the midnight shade‚

As oft they saw, careering in the storin,

Rome on the blast, Τῖιὶιῆἰς12 meteor form,

Or watch'd the clouds whose bright'ning passage
told

Of Pele's ¹³ revels in her mountain hold.

From thought of these, dar-k tree and rugged stone

Assum’d rude shapes of terror not their own,—

For these the H eiau’s gloomy fabric stood,

Deep'ning the horr-ors of some lonely wood;

Nor e’en the whispering oaks in Mona’s dell,

Os ‹lai-ker rites-‚-of stet-ner deeds could tell,

Than those reveal’d by the foul altar's light

That gleam’d portentous on the brow of night3

¹² “ The natives were very desimus ω shew us the place where the
image of 'rairi the war—god stood, and told ua, that frequently in the
evening he used to be seen flying about in the neighbourhood, in the
form of a luminans substance like a fimo, or like the tail of a comet.”
-Poly. Res. vol. iv. c. 5.

¹³ The natives believed the volcano at Kirauea to be the abode of
their goddess Pele—F or a description of the beautiful effect produced
upon the clouds that passed over it by night, when seen stom a dis-
tanoe, see Poly. Res. vol. iv. c. 9.
