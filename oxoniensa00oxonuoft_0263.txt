THE CHINAID. 27

At Fountain’s joy—

And next we plodded o'er Chingchanken earth
To stream of Ooshi‚ and the mount of J aw‚9

To fenny reed of Bulbi! In that night,

The deity did bring a heat intemperate,

And Ho, with holy stream, was set a boiliug3
While he who ne'er had wearied gods with vows‚
On marrowbones now worshipp’d Earth and Heav’n.
And when the host had ceas'd their countless pray'rs
To countless gods, they eross the hissing flood;
And he of ue, before the rays grew warm,

Did “ cut his lucky‚'' 1 was preserv'd and sound.
For, lo! the sun, the burning orb of day,

Did make theshallows bubble with his blaze,
Pellmell they tumble‚ and good luck had he
Who first did snap the.fragile thread of life.

But those remaining, with a wretched toil

To Cochin land are come, (some certain few,)
The land of bacco’ box, so well, alaek,

May Chinese mourn the flow²rets of their soil.
These things are true, tho' many ills escape

That fell divinely on the Chinese host.

9 Jaw] The Latin “Pithecusae,” or “Wilderness of Monkeys.''
The continued “jaw-work'' of these animals in “cracking nuts,'' has
thus given the name to the mountain.

¹ Cut his lucky] I believe the French have a similar expression—
“ coupez vos batons.”
