THE CHINAID. · 43

Cnonus.

« The land of omna, ruler of the land,
ἶ Is bent, is bow'd most lowly on the knee.

Camenae.

Ι know, through me, these realmS, alas, did suck
ᾖ Not sweets, but sours, nauseous to the taste.

Cuonus.

f At thy return, the most infernal row,

· Barbarie noise, and inharmonious strain

²: We'll shriek‚ we’ll shriek in notes of Tartar cry.

Grumum.

Send forth your whining‚ squeaking, piggish screams,

Again the deity has play'd me foul.

Cnonus.

I will exem, aye, crack my heaving lungs,
For all the sea-toss’d grievance of the Μῦες

Ι will e'en spout a cataract of tears

For these defeats by stalwart Britisher.

Our Chinese Mars has reap'd indeed the main,
And gotten plenteous harvest of ¹the dead.

Cumanae.

IIooroarh!⁵² ye swine! acquaint yourselves full well.
