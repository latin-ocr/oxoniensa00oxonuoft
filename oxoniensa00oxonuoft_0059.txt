caumes THE TWELFTH. 11

While front to front with names of martial pride
Renschild and Ho'lstein struggle side by side⁷
Amid the wavering van, that spent and foiled
Like broken billows from the shock recoiled.

“ Onward for Sweden !'’ hark yon voice of might ἱ
It stems, it turns the current of the fight,

‘Mid thronging myriads the commanding form,

Ἴ The cloud-compellet of the living storm3

’Tis Sweden's Hero, his the arm that wields

The doom of empires and the fate of fields.

An hundred years have rolled‚ since yonder sun⁸
Beheld a cro'wn on Clissau lost and won.

There stood two nations in their war-array,

Two rival kings—but they have passed away.
And now when morn is dawning there serene,
ΤῘιθ dew lies ghstening, and the grass is green
Above a thousand graves.—H0w calm they rest,
The weary ones upon earth's quiet breast ἱ
What tho' their sleep be all unwept and lone !

{J} Nature round them a mother's arms has thr-own,
And o'er their beds the skylarks soar and sing

’ Their morning carols thro' the early spring.

⁷ Two of the Swedish Generals.

 

‘⁴ They (the Swedes)

, gave way, were broken, and pursued even into the river. The

King of Sweden tallied them in a moment, above his middle in
water, as easily as if he had been exereising at a review.’'
Voltaire.

⁸ “ The two Kings met on the 13th of July, in the year 1702,

in a vast plain near Clissau, between Warsaw and Craerow.'’
Voltaire.
