borrowed from the same divine promise that speaks of a great
deliverer; when, after the last incarnation of the Hindoo
god, or the completion of the sufferings of the Greek Pro-
} metheus, the time shall come, that the hall of the Walhalla
shall be the scene of new contentions ere its final renovation,
and the genius of good shall for ever banish the evil genii,
and the golden age of innocence and love shall descend again,
' the earth teeming with spontaneous abundance and shining
in perennial beauty.

It is interesting to observe these faint outlines of heavenly
light, obscured as they are by man's ignorance and depravity.
They point us to that religion which can alone satisfy‚ as it
alone can reach the human heart. N ext to this, our attention
is turned to the fact that, in all the systems of Mythology we
are acquainted with, the chief deities have been formed by
conferring divine honours upon some hero and his followers‚
who were of the greatest renown. Thus it has been clearly
demonstrated by Dr. Graves, that the Brahma of the Hindoos
was no other than the Patriarch Abraham; Buddha or Fo
also was the first Chinese emperor3 Osiris of Egypt is syno-
nymous with Sesostris 3 Odin or Woden of Scandinavia was
probably a compound personification of some very ancient
hero and the famous Sigge 3 Tuarira‚ a Polynesian god, was
a famous warrior of Aitutaki‚ and so on. So obvious is this
system of apotheosising heroes, that, according to the cha-
racter of the chief of greatest renown, may be traced the cha—
racteristics of each peculiar Mythology. Fo of the Chinese
was a peaceful monarch, and such is the nature of their
superstitions3 the Celtic warriors were remarkably honourable, > «
and such a feeling of honour is predominant in the character
and worship of their Odin; while the deities of barbarous
nations in Africa and America are represented as more cold-
blooded than the people themselves.

That this daemonology‚ as it is sometimes called, was the
origin* of the Grecian Mythology, we have next to show
