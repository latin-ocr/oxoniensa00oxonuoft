Her children, where are they?
O'erwhelmed by deadly fate,
Slain, each in one untimely day,

By fieree Apollo’s hate.

Her tears shall ever flow,
For ever shall she stand
A snow-white monument of woe,
Upon the storm-lashed strand.

THE DRAMA OF THE GREEKS.

Amr eomparison between the great tragedians Sophocles,
Euripides, and AEschylus‚ must always, to a certain extent,
be an ungracious task. Doubtless every one, acquainted
with the works of the rival three, has selected one of the trio
as the especial object of his admiration, although, perhaps,
unable satisfactorily to account for this preference. Such an
one will, therefore, hear with displeasure any-thing to the
disparagement of the author regarded by him with peculiar
favour 3 a disparagement, however, not to be avoided in a
paper of this kind. To excuse any apparent presumption, it
need only be added, that we do not venture to assign the
palm3 but only intend to bring before our readers a few
remarks on the writings of each. To begin then with AEs-
chylus. This great poet was born⁴ at Eleusis in Attica, in

Ἴ the last year of 01. lxiii. B.c. 525. He was the son of

’ Euphorion, an Athenian, and served, when young, with dis-
J tinguished reputation at the battles of Marathon and Plataea.
