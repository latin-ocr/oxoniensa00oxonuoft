Words that yet live and bum—in whose keen ray
The life and light of Edon] ebb'd away: ἲ
still fading‚ star-like, from the blaze of day ⁰!
And thou too, Petra, tho’ the Roman came
And fann’d thy dying glories into flame3
Carv'd the tall column—rear’d the stately dome—
And seem’d the founder of a second Rome,—
How brief the pageantd'. On >thy dying brow
Men laid a eroum—but who shall crown thee now P -
A thousand summers o'er thy ruins crept:
A thousand winters o’er thy ruins wept:
A thousand years—aud still the very spot
Where once thou wert so glorious, was sorgot!

What joy was his—the wanderiug man, who first
Dissolv'd the spell ;—on whom the Vision burst
Os that enchanted city, as it lay
Bath’d in the splendours of a Syrian day.
O Fancy, thou that must so oft have shed Η,
Dreams of its beauty round his sleeping head3

W'oke in his beart the wild-bird's wish to roam,

And told of marvels in that mountain-home3

θ The prophecies concerning Edom, in fulness and minute-
ness, are second only to those concerning the choseu people ofGod .

d ‘⁴ Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will
retum and build the desolate plaoes; thus saith the Lonnof
hosts, They shall build, bue J will tloerow dem³¹ Malachi i.4.
