The Baocalere
beholdeth the
null-dags, but,
by power of
the Divinity

26 'mn new-nune moesta-az.

And have Ι truly pass'd onan-00 '3
Have I a Baccalere’s gown?

1 turn'd upon the cold flag-stoma,
And I with sobs did pray—

Oh let me now be through annu-00!
Or let me dream alway.

The Radcliffe grass was smooth as glass,
So smoothly was it mown!

And on the grass the moonlight lay,
And the shadow of the moon.

The Schools shone might, the Kirk no
Thlgsssspeaketh by its clock :

The moonlight steep’d in silentness
The gilded weathercock.

All Souls was white with silent light,
Till passing by the same,

Full many men, that Bull-dogs were,
In hats and cloaks there came.

A little distance from All Souls
Those bull-dogs standing were3

I turn’d my eyes into the light-
Alas! what saw Ι there!
