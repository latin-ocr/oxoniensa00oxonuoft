displeased with some lines in the composition, ordered him ’
to strike them out3 Euripides indignantly refused to obey, Α
telling the spectators that he came there to instruct them
and not to receive instruction. In spite of the antipathy he ν
expressed to all the θηλυ γενος, he was twice married, but ,
finding his wives bad specimens of the sex, he divorced
them both; this circumstance may doubtless have induced χ

poetry will die in three days, while mine will live for ages to
come.” The ridicule to which he was constantly exposed,
compelled him at length to quit Athens and take up his
abode at the court of Archelaus, King of Macedonia. The
death of Euripides was as horrible as it was uncommon3‘

rambles‚ tore him limb from limb, 409 years before the
Christian era, in the seventy-first year of his age. It has
been said that Sophocles drew men as they ought to be,
Euripides, as they were. Let us, however, endeavour to be·
