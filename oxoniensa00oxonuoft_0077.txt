CROMWELL. 13

¹¹ He, too, was there—it was the princely boy,
The child-companion of his childish joy !
But oh Ξ how ohang’d—those deathlike features wore
Childhood's bright glance, and sunny smile no more !
That brow eo sad, so pale, so full of care ——
What traee of careless childhood linger’d there ’ἔ
What spring of youth in that majestic mien,
So sadly calm, so kingly, so serene?

Ξ No--all was ehang'd—-the monarch wept alone,
’ Between a ruin'd chureh and shatter'd throne!
¹ Friendless and hopeless—like a lonely tree,

On some bare headland, straining mournfully‚
That all night long its weary moan doth make
To the vex'd waters of a mountain lake!

, still, as he gaz’d, the phantom’s mournful glauce
Shook the deep slumber of his deathlike tranee3
Like some forgotten strain that haunts us still,
That calm eye follow'd, turn him where he will3
Till the pale monarch, and the long army,
Pass'd‚ like a morning mist, in tears away!

Then all his dream was troubled‚ and his soul

Thrill’d with a dread no slumber could control;
. On that dark form his eyes had gaz'd before,
ξ Νοι· known it then ;——but it was veil'd no more !

In broad clear light the ghastly vision shone‚-
That form was his‚-—those features were his own !

'¹ Alluding to the stories of Cromwell’s childish intimacy with

charles the First.
