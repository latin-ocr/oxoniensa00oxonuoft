CHARLES THE TWELFTH. 15

With the still night amand—the stars above,
Those ancient 163611618 with their looks of love3

*³ The sels-same stars, that o'er man's troubled years
J So long have shone from their eternal spheres :

13 Ages beneath have perished—they 3111116,

⁵ And night by night their stillness seems to chide

J This changeful life—the ceaseless ebb and flow,

Τ The weary 1111111011 of the world below.

Yea, these enduring heavens and this green earth——
J That day by day since young 016311011’8 birth
With all their loving language never cease

1 To plead with man and 0311 him back to peace,—
O teach they not that wars and tempests lie
Encompassed with a dread tranquillity,

v That man’s unquiet years of storm and strife

η Α16 but as moments in the deeper life ¹⁰

Of the Eternal Silenee, on whose breast

, An earthly discord sinks in perfect rest?

JOHN CAMPBELL SHAIRP,
BALL101, COLLEGE.

¹⁰ “ Man's noisy years seem momente in the being
Of the eternal silence.”
