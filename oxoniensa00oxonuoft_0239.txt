PREFACE.

Tmz following composition was under-taken purely for
amusement3 nor would it have appeared before the
public, had it not been for the suggestion of a friend.
1f“ anacolutha,'' or any of those hard names in which
critics rejoice, be found, Ῑ can only say in defence,
“ So much the better.'' It will but further my object 3
viz. to invest with absurdity that Parody on a Tra-
gedy, “The Persae of AEschylus.’' With respect to
the nomenclature used, the names of Provinces may
osten be observed to be applied to Persons, but in the
multiplicity of ‘⁴ heroes by flood and field” such an
application is almost excusable. At all events, it
answers the purpose; and by those who are ignorant
of the geography of Ohina, it would not be perceived.
If, however, the “ Burlesque of the Persae” assist in
whiling away some of those hours not bestowed on
more “learned lore,'’ then will be crowned thehighest

wishes and utmost expectations of

THE AUTHOR.
