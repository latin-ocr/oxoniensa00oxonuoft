8 CHARLES Tm: 'erern.

There came a cry—-the conqueror's savage boast—
O'er the poor remnants of his perished host.

He paused, he gazed upon that other shore,
Where suppliant ranks their chiestains aid implore,
And plead with all the eloquence that lies

In veteran looks and glorious memories3

In vain—the arm that taught the world to bow,
The unconquered arm—it bath no vengeance novr.
And can he nought but weep? must bitter tears
Flow from the fountain that hath 'slept for years?
It was a rueful bour—what tongue may tell

The anguish of a warrior's last farewell?

The pang that wrung from that heroic eye

The tears of buming speechless agony?

Shame‚ grief, remorse, that pause concentered all,
The consummation of a mighty fall;

The dreary gathering in one hour of doom

Of all that's darkest on this side the tomb.

'Tis past—that brow is calm—no cloud is there,
The soul within has wrestled down despair.

Yes! he was kingly in his day of pride,

When erst from Warsaw waved his banners wide:
How doubly glorious now with from elate,

He stands unstooping in his bour osfate !

the king more than all the former sufferings consequent on the
defeat of Pultowa. He shed tears at seeing across the river the
greater part os his few remaining friends carried away into ‘cap--
tivity, without his having it in his power to offer thern relies or
assistance.” Universal Histoi-y, vol. 30.
