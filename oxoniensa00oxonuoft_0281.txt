THE CHINAID. 45

Cnolws.

Thou speak’st of nought but sorrow for Chinese.

Camunno-

Thou dost, in sooth, recall those glorious friends,

‚J While thus you prate and chatter of our woe!
My heart doth bump, and thump, and bnmp again! 2!

Cnosos,

Another yet we miss, Tingtong the brave‚
Langshi, and Foosh, that bulky gorging chief
who gloated o’er rat pie with puppy sauce ! ⁴

Cnonus.

τ Hollah! Baloo! Thou moon of vel-dant cheese!
Ye stars chopp’d up, what misery ye make !

having asked the nature of some dish, the Mandarin replied‚ “Me
know not what you eall him, but he say ‘ Bow wow.' ”
