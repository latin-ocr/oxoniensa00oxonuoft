12 THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.

When os the band of thronging priests around‚-—
Of idol forms with sacred cinet ¹⁴ bound,—

Of those rude walls that caught the lurid glare,
Scaree aught seem’d human, save the vietim, there.
Hence oft fell omens urg'd the kindling fight,

The strife of subtlety and savage might,

And Pari’s ¹⁵ ridges eoho’d back the yell

Of those who struggling fought, or yielding fell.
Then was their burst destructive as the tide

Of fiery desolation, from the side

of that tall mount,¹⁶ whose giant shadow lay
Dark’ning the morn on green Kairua's bay.

And isat times their passions, lull'd to rest,

Slept like the fires within the mountain’s breast‚
No soft'ning impulse in their hearts arose,

As round the crater's edge no verdure grows:

In such a soil affection withering died,

For all its springs were clos’d,—its fountains dried.
No soeial bliss could cheer life’s dreary span,

For woman was the powerless slave of man :

¹⁴ The einer. with which the idola were covered, was a species of
rough matting made of the fibres of the bark of the Coeoa nut tree.

¹⁵ “The Pari osAnuanu was an important position in times os war,
und the parties in possession of it were usually masters of the island.
ln its vicinity, the independence of Oahu was lost in or about the
year 1790.”—Poly. Res. vol. iv. c. l.

¹⁶ Mouna fluas-arui, in the side of which is situnted the volonum of
Kirauea.
