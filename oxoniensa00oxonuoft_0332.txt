When the heavy splash of the paddle wheel is rushing
through the (looks,
When thunders out the capitain, high on his paddle-box‚
With shouting and with laughter the story shall be told,
How well the Western Port was freed in the brave days of
old. -.
And then where Gunga's waters bend to the proud East- l
Indiaman 3* Δ
Where Phoebus smiles on balmy isles of dates and cinnamon 3 “
Where ivory-toothed Behemoth treads on Ophir’s golden soil 3
W'here o’er the sand of Guinea land the camel trots with oil ;
Where far Missouri wanders through glens and giant trees3
Where the canoe meanders ’mongst isles of Polynese ς
The voice of fame that wakes this day shall never let the
fun die,
And evermore this song shall flow, “ sic transit ylarious
Monday.”

' T hen where o'er two bright havens, the towers of Corinth frown3
Where the gigantic king of day on his own Rhodes looks down,
Where soft Orontes murmurs beneath the laurel shades‚

Where Nile reflects the endless length of deep red oolonnades,
Where fur-clad hunters wander ’mongst northern snow and ico,
Where o'er the saud of Moming land, the camel bears the spice,
Where Atlas flings his shadow far o'er the western seam,

Shall be great sear on all who hear the mighty name of Rome.
Macaulay’e Lake Reqa‘llus.
