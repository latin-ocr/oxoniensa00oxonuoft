The mud it choked the twofold lock, and swam upon the
flood ;

And when the chestnut Avon ebbed, ’twas nought but mud,
mud, mud.

Woe, woe ! to famed Bristowa, woe to the sinking town !

And woe was murmured by the wind, on the heather-
sprinkled Down.

The sombre ilex bowed its head, and whispered, “ comme il
faut,”

To the sighing of the zephyr, the solemn answer, woe !

“Ah! stay the dismal story, and sound the note of gladness !”

Would that I had yet revealed the half of all the sadness!

For darker is the story, and direr was the fate

Of those three nights of fearful sights, the deeds of rebel hate!

Then passion's turbid revelry inflamed unwonted fires 3

And ruffian cohorts ran to sack the homes of hoary sires,

And drive the panting mother to seek the unfriendly streete,

And scare the eyes of infant babes with Hephaestean feats. r

Some gathered them for riot, and some for plunder burned,

And some in drunken reverie beheld it unconcerned;

Some said, “ I've six small children and a wife at home, to
feed 3

So Ῑ will lend a helping haud in this our time of need.”

'rhen Clifton blushed with horror, to view the rising glare ;

For the flame it arose, where the river fiows, by the old
Reginal Square ς

And far beheld with wonder, the peaceful swain of Aust,

And still the blazing furnace shone to dark Sabrina's coast.

There was a noble mansion, where an aged bishop dwelt;

But see Ξ the fire ascends the wall, the pillared mouldinge
melt.

Now silent are its ruins, and blackened every stone,

Black as the shade, when the moon shines dim, that fills the

cloisters lone.
