EXTRACTS FROM GLYGLUMGLEAGH‚

A LEGE-Nn 01³¹ THE oLDEN TIME.

ΙΝ the midst of a forest, a trackless wood,
There are legends which tell you a castle stood3
And some people say,
To wander that way,
On a stormy day,
Travellers surely would come to no good ;
And after sunset you dare not go,
Oh! no, not by night,
When the moon shines bright,
Or the stars give light;
For there you'll hear such hootings and yellings,
As never were heard amongst mortal dwellings ;
Shriekings‚ ha! ha! and squeakings, he! he!
Shouts as of boisterous revelry.
Groanings and moanings and sounds of woe,
And ev'ry two minutes a terrible—boh! ! l
Reader, if these are the sounds you’d hear,
Or if this is a sight you’d see,
Go, but mind without any sear,
Go, on the first full moon of the year,
Go, to the forest of Glyglumgleagh !
’Tis the name of the castle‚ the name of the wood,
'Tis the place where travellers come to no good!
A noble Hall was Glyglumgleagh,
A castle as strong as you might see :
Ah ! that was in the good old times,
When men did what they willed,
And ne’er were punished for their crimes;
But when a man they killed,
Why then, with very good intent,
And better resolution,
