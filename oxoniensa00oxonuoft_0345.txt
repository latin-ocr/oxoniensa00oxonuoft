l from the many. Euripides, perhaps, excelled both his rivals
in the tender and pathetic. But this is so often followed by
what 1s revolting to the feelings, that a great deal of its effect
is diminished, if not destroyed. We have a strong instance
f of this assertion in the play of the Alcestis. What can be
ι, more touching and beautiful than the character of Alcestis,
the devotion she displayed to her unmanly husband, and her
{³ voluntary death to secure his coward existence? On the
ξ contrary, we are disgusted with the selfishness of Admetus
f in permitting his wife to die for him, and the absurd expect-
1 ation he entertained of his father's consenting to sacrifice him-
ἷ self in her stead. The choruses of Euripides, though often
, misplaced, are always beautiful, and particularly so in this
play. How touching are the following lines, translated by
Professor Austice ι -

“ We will not look on her burial sod
As the cell of sepulchral sleep ;
It shall be as the shrine of a radiant god,
And pilgrims shall visit that blest abode,
To worship and not to weep;
And as he turns he steps aside,
Thus shall he breathe his vow,
‘Here slept a self—devoted bride,
Of old to save her lord she died,
She is a spirit now ;
Hail l blest and bright one, grant to me
The smiles of glad prosperityl’
So shall he own her name divine,
So bend—him at Alcestis’ shrine.”

’ A sweet fault, as Porsen calls it, of Euripides, consists in his
dragging in on all occasions oracular sentences and moral
dogmas; very good in their way, if only introduced at
proper times. This possibly resulted from his having been
the pupil of Socrates. We should always bear in mind, in a
comparison between rival authors, the times in which they
lived3 this is all in favour of AEschylus, since he had no pre-
decessors; an excuse not to be pleaded by either Sophocles
