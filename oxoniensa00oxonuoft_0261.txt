THE CHINAID. 25

Messene-1312.

As many Chinese as were gross in size,

Or did excel in gastronomie art,

Or smoked a ‘⁴ weed'’ in royal confidence‚
All, all are dead by most unnat'ral death.

CASHGAR.

Ah! wo is me! for wretched nexae, my friends!
By what foul death say'st thou the heroes died ’ἱ

Mnssnnessn.

There is an isle, and neighb'ring to Hongkong,

But very small, bad haven for the ships,

Where once did Laokung in sacred danne

Cry “ whoop'’ around his deity of wood—

E’en there he sends them, with the view that when
Their foes were wreok'd from out their frigates bold
And sought the isle, then they should rise and kill
The host of Britishers, an easy prey.

“ But “ill he kenn'd the future ;’' for the day

When Heav'u “ gave Κῦδος” to Britannia ships,
That day, each sailor “ hitch'd'' his breeches round,
And jump'd ashore, surrounding all the isle,

That they were fairly ‘⁴ fiummax'd’' to escape,

And much their poles were hammer’d with the fist,
And many died from stroke of cutlasses;

At last the “ tars,'' with one and loud “ huzza,’'
