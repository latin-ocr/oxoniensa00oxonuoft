Brightens the air, around him and above,
With boyhood' s golden light of peace and love.
Such radiant mnocence, such cloudless mirth‚

Dawn with the springtime o' er the laughing earth,

What time she calls from every green recess‚

Well may ye deem no shade of care or crime
Shall dim the sunshine of his morning prime,

Deem that this trance shall ne'er dissolve to show,

How life's first vision hides a world of woe.
