 

46

Hark! with a shout that rends the air,

He rushes from his mountain lair
With snow-white panoply,

High pride and hate upon his brow,

“ Death to the foes that thwart me now ;
On, on, to victory !’'
How long shall he with murderous yell,

Raven round our citadel?

How long be heard the widow’s cry,

The wailing voice of infancy 2

How long funereal rites proclaim

The death of Thebe’s ancient name?

The red bolt flared, and the warrior fell,
He fell as fall the dead 3

And low lay the pride of that glorious field,

And dimmed was the orb of the silver shield,
As the thunder tolled his knell 3

And then for one short moment
The affrighted armies stood,

And with starting eyes and arms outstretched‚
Watched the dark stream of blood.

They stood for one short moment,
And the very air was still,

Till the lordly voice of a Theban chief
Re-echoed from the hill.

“ Thebans, awake ! for Adrastus is dead,
Awake to your father’s glory !

ΤΙιε fite-bearing king to his last home has fled,
And the Argive lies mangled and gory ;
Fight for your hearths‚ for each sacred fane,

Fight for a deathless story.”
Hark to the din of the enemy flying!
Hark to the eries and the shrieks of the dying!
Hark. and rejoice‚ for Thebes has won,
Ere set for ever the Theben sun!
