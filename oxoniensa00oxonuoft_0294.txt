Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower‚
The moping owl does to the moon complain‚
Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,

Molest her ancient solitary reign.

Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade, i:
Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering 116611
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,

The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.

V.

The breezy call of incense-breathing mom,
The swanow twittering from the straw-built shed,
The coek's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,

No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.
