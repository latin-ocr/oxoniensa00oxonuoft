BATTLE OF THE NILE. 13

chiese had been fain their suppliant gista to bring,
And Gallia's citizen been Salem's king.

witness, fair Ind! if Britain‘s care can bless
Thine abject sons, in number numberless,

Can bid them piet-ce oppression's hopeless gloom‚
And Superstition-—grovelling to the tomb3

Can tell of Heaven, of Life beyond the grave,

cau rear the crosa, and preach its power to save—
'l'hen lift thy voice, then wreathe the grateful smile,
And blesa the names of Nelson and the Nile!
