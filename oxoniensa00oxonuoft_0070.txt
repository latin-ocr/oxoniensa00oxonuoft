6 CROMWELL.

Who scale the cloud-capt height, or sink to rest
In the deep stillness of its shelt'ring breast 3—
Around whose feet the exulting waves have sung,
The eternal hills their giant shadows flung.

No wonders nurs’d thy childhood3 not for thee
Did the waves chaunt their song of liberty!
Thiae was no mountain home, where Freedom's form
Abides enthron’d amid the mist and stol-m,
And whispers to the listening winds, that swell
With solemn cadence round her citadel!
These had no sound for thee: that cold calm eye,
Lit with no rupture as the storm swept by,
To mark with shiver’d erest the reeling wave
Hide his torn head beneath his sunless eave3
Or hear, ’mid circling crags, the impatient cry
Of the pent-winds, that scream in agony !
Yet all high sounds that mountain children hear,
Flash’d from thy soul upon thine inward eer;
All Freedom's mystic language-storms that roar
By hill or wave‚ the mountain or the shore,—
All these had stim-'d thy spirit, and thine eye
In common sights read secret sympathy3
'rin all bright thoughts that hilis or »νᾶνος can yield,
Deck'd the dull waste, and the familiar field3
Or· wondrous sounds from tranquil skies were borne
Far o'er the glistening siwets of windy corn:
