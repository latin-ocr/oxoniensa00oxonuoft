18 THE CHINAID.

Messanam.

No junk withstood3 for mighty Steam did work
A sad confusion in our antique gear.

Cflonns.

Ο bellow forth the wasting hapless cry
For brave Chinese! Alae! how ill it fan-’d
That fell-destroy'd and miset-able host!

Mnssznonn.

Alas ! Amoy! thou cut-sed name to hear!
How shudder I rememb’ring Britishers!

Cnonvs.

O hated name of stalwart Britisber!
I’ troth recount, how many beds it made
To lack their lords, and wives their paramour.

CAsnGAn.

I long ago in sad amazement struck
E’en speechless stood-this ill o’ertops me quite!
I ne'er ean speak, or question of our woes.

But speak compoe’d, though out with it at once,
