THE CHINAID. 11

And thus is lest disconsolate and lone.

But come, ye tenants of this ancient pile,
Come, Mandarins, and pluck your spirits up,
And need there is to see how fares Chingyang,
Keshin·begotten‚ (and he shares our race‚)
Whether ‘⁴ J oe Manton” and the “ patent caps’'
Have beat the lighted match and harquebuss.
But here’s our Queen, a lady with an eye
Would shame the sun. On marrowbones ! I say,
And all address her with a fit salute.
Deep·waisted lady, stoutest dame of all,

Thou aged mother of Chingyang, all hail!
Keshin's delight! and daughter of the Moou,
If now she shine upon the serried host.

CAsnGAR.

On this account I left my gilded home

And common couch of Keshin and myself,

For indigestion lacerates me sore.

To you I speak‚ tho' perseotly compos’d,

Lest hasty Plutus spurn Keshin’s success,

Not gain’d without the deity sublime,

And in a fit of colic turn it o'er.

Two cares most difficult assail me now-—

‘⁶ Chinese depriv'd of opium are as nought;
Without Chinese, no opium would be brought.”
