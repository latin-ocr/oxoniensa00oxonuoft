RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED.

Bmon‘r, as thy name, thy fame shall be,
Honom'd by long posterit53

And when old Bristol's town shall reign

A queen upon the swelling main,

Ages unbem shall hail the bour

When friends and foes confessed thy power,
And carol Freedom, fair of yore,

But ne’er so eoothly bright before.

 

Goon citizens of Bristol ! with loving hearts and true, ⁴

Attend the praise in joyful lays that echoes round to you ς

While reels your every steeple and every belfried tower,

Let shouts employ the people‚ and hail the gladsome hourl

Ye love your ancient city, the city of the waters,

Its noble walls, its antique halle, its myriad sons and
daughters,-
