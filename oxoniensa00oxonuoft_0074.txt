10 CROMWELL.

One moment’s space, perchance, might charin his eye
From the stern future, and the years gone by.

One moment’s space might waft him far away

Το western shores—the death-place of the day Ξ
Might paint the calm, sweet peace—the rest of home,
Far o’er the pathless waste of labouring foam—
Peace, that recall’d his childish hours anew,

More calm, more deep, than childhood ever knew!
Green happy places—like a flowery lea

Between the barren mountains and the stormy sea.

O pleasant rest, if once the race were run !
O happy slumber, if the day were done!
Dreams that were sweet at eve, at morn were sin ;
With cares to conquer, and a goal to win !
His were no tranquil years—no languid sleep—
No life of dreams—-no home beyond the deep--
No sostening ray—no visions false and wild—
No glittering hopes on life’s grey distance smiled—
Like isles of sunlight on a mountain’s brow,
Lit by a wandering gleam, we know not how,
Far on the dim horizon, when the sky
With glooming clouds broods dark and heavily.

Then his eye slutnber’d, and the chain was broke
That bound his spirit, and his heart awoke3
Then--like a kingly river—swift and strong
The future roll‘d its gethei-ing tides along !
