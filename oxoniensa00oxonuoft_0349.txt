‘Tis eve ; the fight is o’er! Who conquered then?
Did Richard? No: the haughty Saracen!

He’ll not submit to Richard’s kingly hand ;
Woe to the day we left our native land !

Woe to those princes, who each other fight,
When the Crusade most needs united might!
See here, and look arouud this gory plain ;
Here lie the corpses of the brave men slain.

As meu they fought, the Holy Laud to free,
Their own dear homes they ue’er again will see!
Their hopes were pure as yonder evening star,
They fought aud fell—how terrible is war! !

[Whilst the Couut is fighting in Palestine, the Baton Vou
Eighmagent plunders his lands ; so the Count having learnt
the news returns home to aveuge himselfi]

The Lady Elfaira thus sang a lament‚
As the brave Sir count Blomouosse ou to fight went.

THE LAMENT.
You are going to ride away, and Elfaira stays behind3
Tbere's uo one left to comfort me, for you’re so very kind3
But mind wherever you may go, be sure come back to
supper,
And if you take a five-burred gate, just hold on by the crupper ;
When you're seated on your horse, with your broad-sword in
your hand,
I sear you'll be for killing all the barons in th'e land;
With your gallaut baud of archers, and your merry men so
brave,
You’ll be taking that proud baron and be making him your
slave.
Tun RusroNsu.
Gheer up! sit down, Elfaira, dear! though on to fight I ride,
In all the battles 1 may see, I'll think of thee, my bride,
