28 THE CHINAID.

Cuoaus.

Ο, toilsome god! how heavy are the feet
That stamp’d too weighty on the Chinese tace!

Casama.

O, wo is me! for devastated land !

Ο nightly vision, clearly in the dream,

'1¹00 clear are woes that thou didst manifest!
Nathless‚ since ye, my Mandarffls, applaud,
I’ll pray the gods, and bring away from home
A mutton chr-ism sot· the earth and dead.

1 know its o'er a hash that’s settl’d‚

But still I hope for “ better luck next tIme.'’
’Tis youm, the Faithful, faithfully to give
Your kindly counsel o’er the fated host;

And should my boy e’en hither wend his way,
O mop him up, conduct him to his home,
Lest ills be added to the ills that are.

Caenus.

Ο, ruling Sun, thou'st been and finish’d quite
The swan-ming magging host of Chinamen,
And cloth’d Pekin, Cantonapa in “ dumps.''
And beauteous maids, all dabbled o‘er in tears,
Do claw their night gear with extended nail :
While Chinese matrone, delicate in grief,

Do fondly wish the couching of their lords;
