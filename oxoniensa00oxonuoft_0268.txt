32 THE CHINAID.

For ne'er did he by misery of war

Destroy his men3 a eounsellor divine,

Divine as couneellor, and so he was,

And well he rul’d the opium-eating host.

Ο come, my lord, approach, thou doughty lord,

And plant thy foot (for haply thou hast ‘⁴ eorns'')
Quite softly on Pagoda’s pinnacle!

Display, besides, that venerable tail

Of grizzled hair bestiffen'd on thy back !

Great father! come, Keshin, Hooroosh! What Hol
That thou, a King, may’st hear a kingdom’s woes,
Both new and old. O, speedily approach,

For Stygian mists have “ doubl’d” all our eyes),
While youth have sunk in ruin on the earth !

Great father! come, Keshin‚ Hooroosh! What Hol
Ο thou bemoan’d so deeply by us all!

O why has horror lighted on thy boy,

And havoc seiz’d his triple row of junks?

Tho’ junks no more, so utterly destroy’d Ξ
(Shade of Keshin asc-ends.)

Knsnm.

Faithful of Faithful‚ playmates of 'my youth,
Ye ag’d Chinese, what's happen’d to the state?
The plain doth howl, and hurly-burly roar,
E'en 1 felt queer beholding 0’ my sponse,

And yet I've had her kindly delugfflg,

While ye, with eries as loud as lungs can clink,
