12 BATTLE OF THE NILE.

And tells how midst the praises o'er him sped,
Whilst bloodless laurels wreath’d his honour’d head,
'Twus his to seize ou Learning’s mugio store,
From Wisdom's quarry dig the prioeless ore,
By worth and virtue win to glory's goul,
And to his country consecrate the whole!

Years have roll'd by, and hoary Time bath east
His deep’ning shadows o'er the mighty Past3
They whose high actions shook the startled world,
Whose arm wrought ven geance, or destruction hurl’d—
Victors and vanquish’d—dastard hearts that fled—
Brave souls that fought—survivors and the dead—-
Like footsteps blotted from the faithless shore,

The grave bath claimed them‚and their fights are o’er.—

The world rolls on—-yet Time itself shall fail
Ere grateful England wearies of the tale3
For not in vain her gallant heroes bled‚⁹
No fruitless laurels twine the victor’s head.
Bear witness, Europe! for 'twas thine to feel
How sharp the scourge, how slow the wounds to heal.
Bear witness, Asia! but for Nelson’s aid
Thy proudest crowns had graced the renegade.

Egypt, and which were frustrated by the loss of his fleat, consult
