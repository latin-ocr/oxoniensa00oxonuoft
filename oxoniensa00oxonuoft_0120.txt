4 BATTLE OF THE NILE.

⁴ Yet¹ deem not theirs the zeal that pants for strife,
The thirst for blood—the reeklessness of life;
No wild ambition with its boundless span,
The praise of History‚ but the scourge os man3
No restless lust—no avariee led them on,
No dreams of empires gained, and golden conquest·
won.

By the blue margin of Aboukir’s bay,
The Gallie fleet in sasety's slumber lay 3
Each spiry mast with pencill’d tracery deck’d
Seemed the mere whim of Fancy's architeeb-
So slight, so losty! not a sail was spread3
The breeze sigh’d gently o’er the water-y bed.—
Ah seeming rest! fond ignorance of ’ποθί
The bright waves glitten· o’er a tomb below.

Mark yonder vessels erowding into sight.
'Tis Nelson's squadron, meing· to the fight.
Heard ye that shout‘t glad sound to Ocean's ear—
'Twas Bravery’s eloqueneo-—a British cheer12
