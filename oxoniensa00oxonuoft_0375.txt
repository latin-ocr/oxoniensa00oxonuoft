This naturally leads us to remark upon the place that classic
mythes have held in poetry. We have hitherto examined the
natural causes which in general have given rise to mythologie
superstitions; we next determined the groundwork of My-
thology to be the deification of some great hero and those
connected with him, illustrating this in the OrientaL Celtic,
and Polynesian superstitious, and partially demonstrating its
truth in Greciau and Roman Mythology3 our third point
was to trace the progress of Mythology as modelled into
system by the bard, and under the influence of the prevalent
notions of ghosts, magio, and luck, which beneath a mass of
superstition concealed much of real history. And now to the
reflecting mind that reviews the subject, that has seen the
‚ veil of mystery removed from the shrine of classic Mythology‚
’ the battle field of heaven let down to the rocky glens and

,ε rough carriage roads of Thessaly, the majestic sovereign of

ξ Olympus transformed into a barbarian warrior, the authors
⁸ of human destiny debased to the condition of robbers and
ὲ fortune-tellers, the famed descent to the world of shades and
> the passage of the Styx and the waters of Lethe exchanged
ᾗ for some invisible trap door by the lake of Acherusia in the
country of Epirus, the direful head that petrified the beholder

ἰ exposed as the unpleasant phiz of some masculine woman-
ν hero, and the ever honoured sisterhood of the Heliconian

Muses metamorphosed into original Ethiopian serenaders ;
what must be the feelings of him who reflects on this tissue
of fabrication and criminality, as he exclaims, Are these the
pictures of Homer, these the refined ideas of virgil, these
the elegant fictions that embellish Milton, these the pleasing

ἶ spells of poetic life which, after deluding and debasing mil-

lions of the human race in the days of Paganism, alike the
civilised and the savage, must still remain to fetter the ima·-
gination and monopolize the admiration of the free-born and
truth-loving Briton ’ἐ
