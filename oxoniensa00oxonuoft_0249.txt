THE CHINAID. 13

The one was prend, and ‘⁶ show’d off in his gear,'’
And prick'd his ears, and “ tooled '’ most gallantly3
The other plung’d‚ and “ bolted” with the “ drag,’'
E'en took the bit between his teeth‚ and snapp’d
The ashen pole asunder. Then, alas!

My boy is thrown! his father, Keshin, eomes,
Stands by his side, and pities him. Chingyang

No sooner saw than “ ripp'd'' his mantle!

These things by night I view’d, and thus I tell.
When I arose, and dipp’d my sever'd brow,

Ι ran, with hands of sacrifice, and heap’d

The tinsell'd paper⁷ on its sacred shrine,

As gists propitious to averting gods.

When lo! a species of the feline rac-3⁸

In terror clinging to the Llama's hearth!

(With speechless fright I stood,) and near her rush'd
A savage large bull-terrier doq Ι ! 19

She nothing did, but screech’d beneath his fangs Ι
Dread things for me to see, and you to hear!

Cnosos.

We would not wish, O mother, to applaud,
Or scare thee with our words, but ask the gods,

7 Tinsell'd paper] Offerings made by the Chinese to their gods.
The poorer class content themselves with old shavings.

⁵ Feline tace] The civet cat is a native os China.

⁹ Bull-terrier dog] Βοιὼ, in his ‘⁵ Freebomiana‚” hath copious com-
ment on this subject.
