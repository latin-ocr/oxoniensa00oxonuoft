Their names, their years, epelt by th' unlettered Mu‘i
The place of fame and elegy supply;
And many a holy text around she strowe,

To ize-ech the rustic moralist to die.

For who, to dumb forgetfuluess a prey,
This pleasing, anxious being e'er resigned,
Lest the warm procincte of the oheerful day,

Nor east one longing, lingering look behind!

XXIII.

On some fond breast the parting sona relies,
Some pious drops the elosing eye requiree;
E'en from the tomb the voice of nature ories,

E'en in our ashes live their wouted fires.
