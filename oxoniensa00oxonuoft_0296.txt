10 ιιιιωγ.

Vl.

Or busy housewife ply her evening aare,

No children run to lisp their sire's return,

Or olimb his knees the envied kiss to share.

Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield;

Their furrow oft the stubborn glebo has 'broke3
How jocund did they drive their team afleld!

How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!

Their hemely joys, and destiny obseure;
Nor Grandem· hear, with. a. disdainful smile,

The short and simple annale of the poor.
