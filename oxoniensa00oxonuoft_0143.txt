Uplisted high—where none but stars can keep
Their bright-eyed vigils round bis lonely sleep.
Fit scene for marvels! In such land should none
But giants move, and gia-nt deeds be done.
O’er such huge hills might fitly seem to stray
A ransom'd people on their homeward way.
In such wild valleys, round their Ark rever'd,
At set of sun their myriad tents be rear’d.
Myriads ! and yet, above them and around,
Such giant features of the landscape frown'd,
They seem’d no more—that people and their guide-
Than J ethro’s flock on Horeb's hallow’d side !

Ah say, ere gather'd in their destin’d sold,
While Israel wander'd o’er this waste os old3
As, eve by eve, upon these mountains brown‚
Silent as snow the heav’nly bread came down 3—-
From the cleft rock as gush'd the sparkling wave
To cheer their sinking spirits, and to save 3-
And the bright pillar, through the livelong night,
Shed o’er their tems its soft celestial light 3—-

up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. And
Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon

Eleazar hisbson5 and Aaron died there in the top os tlte
Mousti-'² Numb. xx. 27, 28.
