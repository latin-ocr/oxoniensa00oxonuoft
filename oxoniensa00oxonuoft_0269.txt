THE offlNAID. 33 ‘

Do take your station at my tomb‚ and bawl,

As if an egress were an easy thing.

But, sure, close-fisted are infernal gods,

And better hands at grabbing than to give.

I’ve “done 'em’' once, and “doubly brown‚” ⁵ I guess!
So, quick, what ill has fallen on Chinese?

Look sharp, 01· else I vow Ι shall be “ gated.”

From qualms of old my very tongue is tied.

, My aged sponse, thou partner of my bed,

Do cease that loud untimely bellowing,

⁴ And tell me straight, for men will get involv’d

By land and sea, in miserable woeS‚

:- Just only give the puny mortals time.

CAsqun.

O thou that didst all mortale overthrow

“have come the artful'’ over the infernal gods.
