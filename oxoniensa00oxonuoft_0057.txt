cfflRLEs THE Twssnrm. 9

Aye, his the pride, the all-enduring wi11¹‚

’Mid sternest suffering, how serenely still!
Others are drooping round him—his the mood

, That will not yield, and cannot be subdued:
E'en now with light from memory’s regions cast,
The future shines all glorious as the past,

⁷ And dreams and visions from the tented plain,

f Come wildly gleaming o'er his soul again.

So, when the winds that raved the live-long night,
Have stilled their tumult with the dawning light,
So have I seen the cloud-rael< fast and free,
Come thro'nging onward from the distant sea
Along the hill-tops‚ till the rising sheen

Of mom had spread their parted woof between,
And laughed awa-y themasses dark and dull

Into a radiance glad and beautiful3

E’en thus the glorious past came floating by,
O'er the dark chambers of his memory;
Revealed before him in long line he saw

⁴ Denmark and Narva, Dwina and Clissasn

1 Eaeh with its throng of phantom hosts appears,
Bathed in the light of unforgotten years.

⁴ ‘⁶ Une si sacheuse situation, apres le disastre que l’on venoit
d'essuyer, repandoit la tristesse sur le visage d'en chacun. 11
faut pour-tant en exceptet de roi; car ce Prince paroissoit toujours
· {e meme: nulle crainte apparente, 11111 changement dans son
vinage, et nulle plainte dans sa bouche.'’ Puff. Hist. de Suede,
vol. 3.
