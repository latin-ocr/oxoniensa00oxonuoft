THE CHINAID. 37

But when a man himself may ope his jaws,

The god will ram the sable mixture down !⁷

And thus my son unwittingly has ‘⁴ sold,”

“ Let in” his friends, who succour’d his mad plan

To raise a fortress, and of bricks all made

Of mud, old straw, brown paper, any thing.

But, Mandarffls, Chingyang was lunatio !

And now Ι sear, lest all my gotten gold

Do thus be snatch'd “ First comer, poo, first serv’d.'’

CAsnGAn.

Chingyang, I sear, did keep bad company!
For all the wealth that thou didst win by war,
He warred away upon his downy couch,
And play'd the woman with his dainty airs!

⁷ 'Twas thus he learnt to form the mad design, ·

To thwart the will of lordly Britisher.

Knsnm.

But well, they've done imperishable werke,

Such glorious deeds as Pekin ne’er has seen

Since Buddha gave one man alone to hold,

Alone to sway the realms of Mulberry.
Mieksbrede at first did reign3 and then his son,
Whose ire was steer'd by Captain Common Sense3
And third from him, Poopoo, a pleasing man,

ῗ Sable mixture] Poeticae for “ black draught„”
