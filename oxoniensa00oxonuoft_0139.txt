Smmm of Song! that ost at dewy eve,
When Elfin sprites their frolic dances weave‚
Meetest the poet as he walks unseen
The twilight valley, οι· the dusky green ;—
Or by some mountain lake's romantio brim
Wakest the drowsy echoes, all for him ;--
And many a time art well content to stray
Where garden-alleys quench the* blaze of day,
And small birds sing, and babbling fountains play:
Know’st thou the land—a land os giaut mould—
By Heav’n assign’d to Edom's race of old-i’

ί “ 1 have given Mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.’'
Deut. ii. δ.
