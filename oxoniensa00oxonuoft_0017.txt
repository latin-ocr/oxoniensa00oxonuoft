THE SANDWICH ISLANDS. 13

Few joys of offspring check'd the wish to roam,
01· cast a spell around his sullen home3

His infants' claims provok'd guilt’s fodlest stain,
And stamp’d his portion with the curse of Cain.
Ost as the sleeping babe uneonscious smil'd,

A mother's yearnings pleaded for her child,
Yet heedless of her tearss—her prayers to save,
A father’s hand consign'd it to the grave,

To wake no more, until its spirit stand

In sweet communion with that glorious band
Of cherub angeIS,¹⁷ who before the Throne

For that frail sinful race make aye their ceaseless moa 11.

Nor is that cry in mim—though voiceless all
Heaven's angel host, yet Mercy hears their call :
And Mercy’s answer is the whispering gale
That smooths the folds in yonder swelling sail,
And speeds in safety through the salt sea foam
'rhat goodly vessel to its destin'd home.

Yes! from the bosom of the Eastern wave

· The ministers of Mel-cy come to save,-—.

To those benighted islands to proclaim

The joyful tidings of a Saviour’s name.

Their fervent zeal has mark’d with deep’ning awe
How long those isles have waited for His law.¹⁸
