Loud let our daughters their freedom sing,

Loud let the shouts of the conquerors ring,

Til] echo shall answer from earth's utmost bound,
And far o’er the ocean our Paean resound3

For again we are free, as the waves of the sea,
As the winds that sport in their careless glee,
We are free, we are free !

Lm others sing the land
Where the two bright havens smile,
Or chant the praise in gladsome lays
Of Rhodos' sunny isle 3
Of plains where Peneus wanders
Through many a forest glade‚
And murmuring streams gently flow
Beneath the cypress shade ;
Of the ancient Bacchian city,
Where seven dark portals frown,
Or where Minerva's citadel
Grimly on earth looks down ;
Of Argos, famed for homes,
And Messene, famed for men,
Of where the brave three hundred
y Of old well kept the glen ;
Of Larissa's golden harvests,
And Apollo's favoured shrine 3
of Pelion's hills and Tempe’s rins,
And the house of the Delian nine.
