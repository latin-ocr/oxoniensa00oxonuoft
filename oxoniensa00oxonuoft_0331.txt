’ The sweeper at the crossing shall fill his coffers now,
ι. And suck St. Michael’s oranges with a smile upon his brow.

fi. Hark! hark! the bells are chiming their matins brisk and
³ “ sweet 3*

ἑ ’ Now let the long procession adorn the winding street !

And first the green coat warriors to fire salutes with a pistol ;

’ Let the civic Council follow the Mayor, with silver trumpets

festal ;

> Ἴ Be the Tribune boine sublime in air, who fought so well for

Bristol !
And let each working company with its insignia come,

, The royal Odd Fellows with sceptre and bellows‚ and every

club with a drum ς
, And let each bright fite-engine‚ fed with the dew of heaven‚†
Advance to pour libationsss on the wildly—laughing Avon!

, And when the shades of evening spread, go down to Mar-

dyke serry,
And sail along to Prince's bridge all in a little wherry 3
And you shall see on Brandon Hill volcanic flames aspire,
Stars with the heavenly bijoux vie, and all the air be fire.
And still, whene’er in the eventide the steamers come, puff!
puff 1
Up the stream to the basin’s side (which wont be half large
enough) ;

= When the brilliant lamps are dancing upon the dark brown

wav
When thee'boats do reel, and the pigs do squeal, and the very
dogs do rave 3

* This is not to be considered a description of the procession, as it was
