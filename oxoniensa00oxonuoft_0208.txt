Of what College ox· Hall art tho‘u 'P'

Forthwith this frame of mine was wrench'd
With a woful agony,

'rhough with a lecture stern and long
The Proctor set me free.

Since then, at an uncertain hour
This agony returns,

And, for that I have droonken been,
This heart within me burns.

The Baccalere What loud uproar bursts from that door? ’Ξ

' And in the garden are the Dona
And Freshmen walking a113
And har-k! the little vesper bell,
That biddeth me to hall!

Oh! sweeter than the wine-partie,
'Twas sweeter far to me,

Το walk to convocation-House‚
And there to take degree 2-

To walk to Convocation-House‚
And there the sees to pay3
While bend to the Vice-Cancellere‚
Schola, and Cim-k, and Commonere,
And they all take B. A.
